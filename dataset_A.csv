abfrvj,13wqr9a,Fear of being a foreigner/supposedly having money?,"I'm far from being able to do this, but I think I want to go live somewhere cheaply/work remotely/have recurring income, that sort of thing. Thailand(chengmai?)/Vietnam/shenzhen, random places.

My concern is if you're a foreigner, aren't you a target automatically like ""Oh this guy/gal could have money""

Try to blend in, I mean I'm mostly interested in the freedom/lower living expenses as long as have decent internet. Good local street food.

The other concern is like being in a foreign place, culture like ""oh shit... everyone doesn't like me? hmm""

Thoughts?"
abp9dx,zcpza,How to get started as a freelance translator with no formal qualifications?,"Greetings!

I'm a last year university student living abroad. I have no formal qualifications whatsoever in languages but I got really interested in working as a freelance translator, due to the flexibility that it seems to provide.

I happen to speak both English and Spanish fluently, which I've heard is a good combination to have in the business. I'm also studying Biology, so I also have a good grasp on the scientific/academic jargon. 

I was wondering if I could get some suggestions on how to get started, and perhaps a list of sites I should know about. Resumé suggestions are also very welcome!

abru9f,40plk,"Need advice - Need to stay somewhere near the USA, within 6 to 12 hours of travel to LA","Hello Nomads,

&#x200B;

I am an Indian Citizen and have an offer to work in Medical Informatics as a consultant for a company based in SF, CA.

Most of the work can be done online but I might be needed to attend meetings on-site from time to time. The meetings are almost always pre-scheduled so I might have a day's notice in advance.

&#x200B;

I have a B1/B2 US Visa valid through 2026 and I believe I can travel on business purpose for meetings to the US. I won't be spending more than 30-40 days in the entire year in the US so I hope I won't run foul of any immigration rules.

I am looking for a nearby country to stay in and work so that I can get to SF in under a day's travel. I must be able to get by with English, low crime and a decent standard of living at a comparatively lower cost. My family may not join me yet, but I must factor in that possibility too.

Belize, Mexico are some of the options I am looking at. I may have to apply and get a work permit / residence permit, but I would love to hear from you about pitfalls, what to look for, advice, etc.

&#x200B;

Please let me know if any more info might help.

acfzhw,25fj0ip7,When to move on from a place?,"Hey all,  


I haven't stayed in a place more than a month since January 2017, and was hoping to slow down my travel speed in SE Asia to regroup.  Went by nomadlist, and general recommendations for Canggu in Bali, and arrived about a month ago.  It's been a mixed bag so far, and I'm not sure whether or not to stick with it, or move on.  I work online as an English teacher and writer for reference  


\+Being by the beach is nice(10 minute drive), and local food is good and cheap.  Good place to read a book, or write by hand, but obviously no laptop work there.  Community is ok, hard to figure out who's staying long term vs tourist, but the other nomads I've met are nice.  Kind of a flashy hipster crowd, lots of insta folk and huge Australians.  Cafes/bars are pretty spread out, quality ok, and I haven't found a great place to work or hang out at yet.  Most are rather small on the inside.  Weather is nice, it's rainy season, but doesn't last long even if it does.    


\-Honestly my main gripes are the complete lack of walkability, ""third"" places, trash.  I rented a scooter, and am super comfortable on one, but I still like having some part of town, or even just a trail, where I can just chill and walk with music/podcast.  Here that's a complete no go aside from the beach, the streets are narrow and flooded with locals and tourists driving crazy alike.  Not a ton to do aside from the beach unless you make a full day trip somewhere else.  The trash isn't as bad as India, but often the beach in the morning when I go to run is just wrecked.  It's depressing, and gross to try to work around.  Of course any time you are on a scooter too you will be breathing in exhaust, but that's pretty much anywhere.  Like I said, haven't found a good place to just chill at casually.  Activities like yoga/gym members ships are 100+ a month, which seems ridiculous.    


The two other options I was looking at was heading to Chiang Mai in Thailand, or somewhere in Vietnam like Ho Chi Minh more likely the former.  Haven't been to either.  I've heard the cost of living is lower in both, and each have more of a city vibe.  Ho Chi Minh has same pollution/crowded problem I hear, but good in person TEFL opportunities.  I started to settle a little bit here, and maybe it'll just take more time to get used it.  Just feels like for me it's a 6-7/10 fit, but there's no guarantee the next place will be better(could be far worse!)  


Any advice on a place that might be a better fit, or if I should give Bali a little more time?

acgqm9,,Protector monitor screens in luggage,"Hi folks,

I know that bringing monitors in checked luggage has come up a few times here before.

I am currently working for a few weeks in another country and packed a 21 inch LED monitor to take with me on my trip.

Although I was very careful to surround it with clothes, the screen was unfortunately broke and unusable on arrival - so my success rate is 0/1!

Are there are better ways to pack monitors that mitigate against this risk?

I really don't want to have to check it as a separate luggage item (hassle and expense) and packing it with the original packaging intact would take up a lot of volume in my luggage. I'm not so keen on the portable USB monitors as I find them too small and like the stands ""regular"" monitors come with. 

I feel like somebody must have invented some clever solution (like a clip on screen guard). And if not, somebody should!

I have office skills and am generally pretty smart and can figure things out, but I do not have an education in technology or coding and I'm far better at fixing a chainsaw than a computer. I don't consider myself exceptionally creative or artistic. I've been looking into different types of remote jobs and am finding myself overwhelmed by trying to find the correct fit.

aeenmb,perpm,Some questions for Aussie Nomads,"Hey guys,

I've got a few specific questions that fellows Aussies would be best situated to answer. 

&#x200B;

Taxes: 

I've done the [tax residency test](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/International-tax-for-individuals/Work-out-your-tax-residency/Residency-tests/) and I might be able to declare myself a foreign resident for tax purposes. I believe I can answer No to this question "" Are / were you an Australian resident for tax purposes immediately before leaving Australia? **\*""** Because I've been living overseas ""permanently"" for the last 7 years, therefore not paying tax in Australia (I was under the threshold during that time, anyway. I've been in Australia for just two months on a holiday. 

Any idea if that qualifies me as a non-resident? If it does, is there any obligation to prove I'm paying tax in another country (obviously not something I want to do as a DM, i.e. too much hassle getting a work visa and TFN in each country). Note I only earn 30,000-40,000 AUD, so hardly a big fish for the ATO to chase up. 

According to ATO ""As a foreign resident, you only need to lodge annual Australian income tax returns if you receive income from sources in Australia.""

Does money earned while physically overseas (DNing) that comes through an Aussie bank account count as ""in australia?"" What about earnings from Aussie clients while physically overseas?

I'd obviously prefer to discuss this with a qualified accountant but I've read many charge upwards of $5000 for a letter of advice. Any recommendations for cheaper services/costings?

Expenses and filing:

I guess I can claim for some work expenses such as laptops, internet, maybe even some travel (I do a lot of travel writing). Do I need to do anything other than keeping electronic receipts and claiming them at the EOFY? Should I get an accountant involved or is being a freelancer simple enough to file solo?

ABN:

Say I go down the Australian resident for tax purposes route (which I'll probably have to), do I need an ABN for my freelance business? I work independently as a content writer, with most payments coming through PayPal and ultimately my Australian account. 

Insurance: 

It seems to me that global health/expat insurance is only really useful for Yankees (and others) who pay out the arse for coverage in their home country. If I got cancer or whatever other chronic illness I'd just fly home for treatment on Medicare. Therefore, travel insurance is more suitable for us.

Any holes to the logic in this line of reasoning?

Any travel insurance that's particularly good value for the DNs? 

Finances:

I've got a Citibank Plus account which has an awesome no-fee withdrawal policy. 

But what about being paid? I normally receive money in PayPal (fees) and send it to my Australian bank (more fees) before withdrawing in local currency (minor forex fee). Anyone found a better way for Australians to do this? 

&#x200B;

I know that's a lot. If anyone can answer any of the above from personal experience than I'd be super appreciative :-)

Some things to note off, I have a passport from a third world country, so its difficult for me travel to other countries consistently. Thats the reason I am looking for a stable base. Some places I have looked at are montevideo, medellin and Buenos Aires. I am leaning towards uruguay since they have the easiest way to get long term residency and they also seem the most stable. But reading from a lot of posts, it seems montevideo is pretty boring after a while.

afywol,12oik4,Don't be afraid to go home,"I just wanted to say don’t be afraid to go home and here’s why….

So I was one of the ""I will figure it out on the road"" people. Before taking the leap, I spent over a year building up my freelance business on the side. I saved up a chunk of money as a cushion. I knew it wouldn't be enough to sustain myself but I was confident I would figure things out and eventually earn enough to make ends meet. I DIDN'T.

Fast forward 5 months, Nothing progressed like I had expected and I was starting to get nervous. I didn’t really have money coming in and my savings was depleting fast. I wasn't sure if I'd actually be able to pull this off.

After 5 amazing months on the road, I decided to go home....although I always associated going back home with failure. I figured free rent couldn’t hurt…. Unfortunately, I didn't reach success in those 5 months on the road as I anticipated...but I did learn WHAT NOT TO DO.

I went back to the US and took my mistakes with me. The pressure of expenses quickly started to tempt me to go back to a corporate job. But I thought I'd give things one last shot and I did. Shortly after arriving home, gigs sort of started popping up out of nowhere and work started creeping in. It was quite bizarre and unexpected. My determination in addition to my presence in the US was a game changer. Fast forward four months, and I am now a full-time freelancer. I am laser focused on my business now and things have never been better.

Simply being here has opened up more doors than being abroad did. I didn’t really network or anything. Opportunities just started arising. It definitely helped that I knew where not to look now and started to figure out the best place to find work.

I am planning to hit the road again in a month or so but this time with a bit of experience. 

Don't be afraid to go back home and focus. Learn from your failures and overcome them!"

Excluding transportation, insurance and visas, I try to spend less than $20/day.

I think I've already experienced the best of Southeast Asia in terms of value for money. I feel like everywhere else will either be crappier or more expensive. Should I bother visiting other places?

Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Philippines and Indonesia (excluding Bali) don't seem as appealing.

Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia seem interesting, but more expensive.

Bali seems like the next most promising destination, but it has its own inconveniences (short visa, long/expensive flights, less developed). Can I live there for $20/day, without cooking my own food or renting a scooter?

agbsxz,1b9rx6ia,Does anyone use Safetywing travel insurance?,"I found Safetywing on Product Hunt a while back. The website caught my eye because it essentially is pushed towards digital nomads specifically. 

They offer some great stuff but I want to hear other people's thoughts on them. I haven't seen a lot on them online but if anyone has experience with them, that would be awesome.

It is cheap ($36/month) and has solid coverage from what I can see.

They also offer two great things for me that other travel insurance doesn't cover:

- They still provide the same coverage for me whether or not I have my Canadian provincial health care coverage. OHIP technically kicks you off their program if you are out of the province for more than 182 days a year, so this is big for me.

- Connected to that, it takes 3 months to reapply for OHIP if I wanted to move back to Canada so I would be health-care-less for 3 months at minimum. Safetywing says they provide 30 days of coverage in my home country for every 90 days travelling outside of the country which is quite enticing.

Anyone have some thoughts on it?

agm2bh,8lgcz3c,Upwork To Scale or Start Your Digital Nomad Life,"Yo Hustlers,

&nbsp;

My Story: Couple of months ago I was desperate for getting my first social media clients. As like many of starting entrepreneurs, I was at the stage of ""How the f*ck I get my first clients"". To be honest, I watched probably hundreds of videos on how to do it and even though the information was great there was still something that prevented me from getting my first $$$ retainer. But one day one of my friend's friend said that he got 4 new clients in just a month adding up to $15,000 a monthly retainer. Holy shit... For real. Holy shit...
 
&nbsp;


I asked how?...

&nbsp;
 
-Upwork!- He said.

&nbsp;
 
My first thought was disbelief. Aren't these freelancers sites only for cheap people who are willing to work for $1/hour? Like 3rd world countries?...

&nbsp;
 
Nonetheless, I tried it my self...

&nbsp;
 
And Baaaaam!!! These were the answers I got https://imgur.com/lfXPcIG

&nbsp;

**In just first month, without putting a really big effort got my first $1000/month client.**

&nbsp;
 
Well, $1000 is nothing nearly $15,000 month, but it is a really big step forward knowing that I was sitting on 0 just recently.

&nbsp;

**So what have we done differently than other Upwork freelancers?**

&nbsp;

After I got the first client, I started searching for my own freelancers.

&nbsp;

And to no surprise, most of the proposals, like 95% of them were completely terrible. Copy paste, terrible English, almost every sentence starts with ""I"", blablabla… Promising to make me millions in a matter of seconds just by doing VA (Virtual Assistant) job.

&nbsp;

A little bit exaggerated the last sentence, but you get the point. 

&nbsp;

The same goes for other jobs, everyone is doing the bare minimum to land a client.

&nbsp;

**What I have done differently I was putting time into the proposal:**

&nbsp;

I Analyzed the key sentences of job offers

&nbsp;

I Structured my proposal focused on those sentences

&nbsp;

I Looked on Clients pay history to get an idea of what price he is comfortable paying.

&nbsp;

I Wrote, light non-formal proposals - No Mr’s Miss’s, please. If you have a sense of humor, USE IT! 

&nbsp;

I Added sentence of empathy in the end: “Don’t overstress your self by reading other copy-paste proposals, haha”.
This is really important, if you are fast enough to be among the first one to apply for the job, you are setting the frame and every other proposal will more likely to look like a copy pasted and ungenuine shit.  

&nbsp;

**REALLY IMPORTANT:** Be fast responder and get on the call immediately, most of the clients don’t want to make tons of interviews, be the first, have at least OK interview and a big chance you will be hired. 

&nbsp;

The best responses I was getting from video + unique text proposals, so that is what I would really recommend you doing. Even though when I started sending videos, I quickly got a client from older proposals and stopped the client search for a while.

&nbsp;

Overall, make the hiring process for a client as simple as you can.

After deciding which Penta house I will buy and the color of my Lambo I thought to my self that it would be great to hustle more and start documenting the journey from $1000/month to $15,000/month.

So decided to ask Holy Knights of Reddit opinions if they would be interested in watching a YouTube documentary series on ""Getting good paying clients while traveling"" (Thailand -> Taiwan -> Lithuania -> Ukraine?...)

agu05v,5dqtp,Use local data plans and keep your main phone number while abroad -- a guide to setting up eSIM and freeing your up your SIM tray,"The latest iPhones have an awesome new ability for people who travel abroad…eSIM! 

&nbsp;

If you are like me, the first thing that you do when you land in a new country is buy a SIM card from a local store to get access to a local cellular data network at a reasonable rate. International data rates from US carriers are much more expensive than local rates, and the costs quickly add up while traveling. The problem is, I have to swap out the SIM card with my main phone number on it, which disconnects access to my main contact number. This results in missing calls and text messages. Perhaps the biggest annoyance is that iMessage and FaceTime lose no longer work with the main number. All of this causes lots of confusion for those trying to reach me.

&nbsp;

This problem can be fixed now with the iPhone XS/XR! These iPhones can be set up to have two separate phone numbers with two separate data plans. So, when you travel you can keep your existing mobile number, while also accessing a data plan from a local carrier. Even if you don’t plan to receive calls or texts from your main number, just having this eSIM in the phone will allow you to continue using your main number for iMessage and FaceTime. This is big for me.

&nbsp;

This is all enabled by eSIM — a virtual SIM card that stores SIM information in your phone without a physical SIM. Connecting to your primary line with eSIM leaves the physical SIM card tray available to connect to an additional line.
When you got your phone, the carrier most likely set up your phone number on a physical SIM card, so that is probably how you have it connected right now. We want to move main number to be on the eSIM. To do that we will add the eSIM to our phone then have the carrier point the main phone number to this new eSIM. From there we can remove the old SIM.

&nbsp;

The first thing that you need to do is get an eSIM QR code from your carrier. This process is different for each carrier. I contacted AT&T via online chat and they sent me a printed QR code in the mail. Verizon can send these eSIM QRs over email. The most important thing is to be clear with the carrier that you do not want to sign up for any new lines or services. You simply want a new eSIM with no associated lines. From there we will add this eSIM to our carrier account and transfer our phone number to it.

&nbsp;

**How To Transfer Your Existing Phone Number To eSIM:**

1. Once you have the eSIM card, on the iPhone go to Settings > Cellular > Add A Cellular Plan.

2. Scan the QR code to add the new eSIM card as a line on the phone.

3. You will now configure the new line. Label it Secondary. Keep Primary as default line.

4. You will now need to transfer your phone number to this new SIM. Get in touch with your carrier and tell them that you need to “transfer your phone number to a new eSIM with a different ICCID number"".

5. Give them the ICCID number associated with the eSIM QR code.

6. Once they have completed the transfer process, restart the iPhone.

7. Go back to Settings > Cellular and see that both Primary and Secondary should be configured with your phone number.

8. Remove the physical SIM using a SIM tool and put the empty tray back in.

9. You will see the old line still there saying “Used to be xxx”, tap it. It will prompt you move your contacts over to the new line. Do it.

10. That line should now disappear leaving you with only one line, with your correct phone number.

11. Within the next few minutes you should receive an alert about your default line changing. Press OK.

12. You should now be connected as before, only now your SIM tray is empty and ready for a secondary line!
Now, when you land in a new country, you can grab a local SIM and pop it right in the tray.

&nbsp;

**How to connect a new local SIM card:**

1. Buy the SIM card and make sure it is the right size.

2. Insert the new SIM card into the tray.

3. You should see a prompt to set up the new plan, press Continue

4. Give the new line a recognizable name.

5. Click Use “Primary” as your default line.

6. In the Update Contacts screen set “Primary as the preferred line”.

7. Once it’s done, under Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data you can configure which line to use for data.

&nbsp;


That’s it! You can now make and receive calls and texts at both numbers and will only access cellular data through the local carrier. Each time you start a new call or message there will be an option to change the number you are calling from. You can even assign a specific line to each contact so you can choose which SIM card to use when placing calls to that specific person. This is useful if you want to make calls local calls to people that you meet locally. Make sure to be aware of any international roaming charges you might incur doing calls and texts from your main phone number.

&nbsp;


Now you can stay connected at home while taking advantage of all that the local carriers have to offer!

Ever since I was very little I have been interested in computers and I have some programming experience, mostly with web programming and design: front-end and back-end Javascript, CSS, a bit of basic database stuff, some frameworks and so on.  I have completed a personal project on my own working on all of these aspects and I know that it's a bit frowned upon by some but my ambition is to also formalize my knowledge somewhat by trying to complete most of MIT's OpenCourseware computer science curriculum in whatever time it takes me (inspired by Scott Young, of course).

I also speak both English (certified C1 level) and Spanish, so perhaps I could also explore options in that direction.

So, let's say I hone my programming skills to a decent enough level that I can provide some evidence of what I know to a potential employer, would it be possible to get good international programming gigs so that I can build myself a lifestyle of this kind? Considering of course that I have no related degree and that I live in a developing country. 

I know this isn't easy but I want to know if it is at least realistic for someone like me.

Thank you. "

I've posted in r/careerguidance about my situation before, basically I'm thinking of quitting my current job and focus on building up a skill set within a few months so I can start the DN lifestyle. I've dabbled in some Facebook marketing and Web design but nothing serious. Maybe try out a few courses, SEO etc and see which I like or is in high demand. 

I just finished a short trip in BKK/ Chiang mai and fell in love with the latter. Experiencing CM gave me the motivation to want to do this and its definitely my first choice for a destination. I have a comfortable 3k a month job at home but I just feel the life getting sucked out of me the longer I stay in my home country (Singapore). I know I'll feel dead inside again once I'm 2 weeks back into work. I have about 8k in savings, and the lack of income will really motivate me to focus on building up my skill.

 I'm not 100% going through with this, I'm hoping to get advice and insight from people who have been in my situation before taking further action.

ahp9lb,2pzivsx3,Simplewall: a little program to gain total control over the network connections of your computer,"I often struggle with slow internet connections in rural areas. The last thing I then want is some software downloading huge update packages in the background. Windows 10 has made it tricky to disable automatic updates and a background service called “delivery optimization” is using your pc to deliver updates to other computers. If you do not have fast internet, that service can consume big parts of your bandwidth.

I now found a little freeware program called Simplewall that gives me total control over my network connection. It blocks all programs trying to connect to the internet unless I allow the connection. A little window pops up every time a program tries to connect to the internet. I was astonished how often that happens.

Usually, I do not like to install such little helpers if something can be done with a simple change of my settings. But this one is an exception. It is extremely lightweight (only 1 MB) and does nothing but exactly what you expect it to do.

akb9jr,23sf7g03,My Experience Being in Cyprus for 1 Month,"This isn't a spot I hear about people visiting, so I wanted to share my two cents for those interested in considering Cyprus. I have general prices listed throughout this, but a main total is at the end.

*One thing to note: it's currently off-season and accommodation prices will soon rise - I'm thinking around April or so, then it will die back down around September.*

I'm staying in a town next to Larnaca (third largest city) and it is dead. But I love it. It's one of those places that you can explore within 3 days and know exactly where everything is. The town I'm staying in has one little 'downtown' area with 1 grocery store, a few restaurants, and that's basically it aside from small mom & pop shops, but even those are far and few. I'm also right next to the sea, so taking walks by the coast is very peaceful.

The locals are impressively friendly (I had no expectations since this is my first run around southern Europe) and they've gifted me with too many things. I visit a little shop for Greek pita about 3-4 times a week and the guy gives me free beer, I smiled at a guy on the street and he gave me a million little Greek donuts - Cypriots are very kind from my experience.

It's been a nice, chill spot to take some time for myself. I wouldn't stay here longer than a month - as this will get tiring and boring during month 2, but 3 weeks in and I'm extremely comfortable and loving it.

The accommodation is all up to my standards, larger than I need, but I didn't have many choices within my budget. Came to a little less than $600 for the month. It has two bedrooms, a living room with tv + sofa, a large desk, balcony, full kitchen with oven range and a washing machine. You can definitely find cheaper during the off-season, the other apartments were a bit too far from places for me.

I also know there's a pretty cheap hostel in the city for about 9 euros a night (if I remember correctly) - so the options are definitely there for lower budgets.

Internet is supposedly the worst in Europe, but still way better than a lot of my experiences in SE Asia. It's stable and averages at around 15mbps and again, I'm not in the city.

I walk everywhere. Taxis are expensive (comparing to past experience in SE Asia). Cost me $25 to get from the airport to my place, about a 15 minute drive. However, the environment is nice to be around, days are sunny albeit a bit cold still. Temperature has been around 15 degrees Celsius, but is beginning to rise now. This is definitely not a time for you island lovers to visit, I don't think the sea water is warm until about June. But if you just want to travel and hit up a new place, I find Cyprus to be enjoyable.

The food is delicious. A Greek pita runs me 2.50 euros each time. I cook at home a lot, usually a vegetable roast (potatoes, onions and carrots) with chicken. 1L of wine is 2 euros and Cyprus Red Wine certainly is unique and delicious! A nice dinner out can cost anywhere from 8-15 euro, and they will give you plenty of food. My total food expenses (groceries + eating out) will probably run me around $175 USD by the end of the month.

And overall total spending (accommodation + all expenses) at around $800-$850 for the month.

So yeah, Cyprus is chill. I like it and I'd come back to take advantage of all the hiking/sight-seeing opportunities when it's a tiny bit more warm. However, I wouldn't spend more than I am now for the off-season.

\---

Sorry that I switch between USD and euros so much. I remember prices for things in the local currency, but know overall total prices in my home currency."

akh9sv,dyzlw,Recommended offshore bank account ?,"Hi, 

I am a freelance game developer and earn ~$50k/year, been doing it for the past 6 years, and i started making my own games so am expecting that number to rise (or fail miserably haha),  i have a local company which most of the money go in, and i use payoneer to do my online shopping. 

Since my country (Tunisia) have some very strict (and dumb) rules when it comes to international payment, for example, if am going to travel, then i can only take with me $3000 **per year**, not per travel, and if i want to shop online then am limited to $2500 per year with a credit card that work mostly on ""IT services"" (google, apple, buying server hosts, etc..). 

Long story short, 

My country economic struggle is limiting my freedom, if i keep going the local way, then i'll be earning $50k per year with the ability to just spend $5,5k per year, and there isn't anything interesting for me here (locally) to spend my money at, 

As for Payoneer, its great for receiving money, but its very restrictive when spending it, it works perfectly fine with ATMs worldwide which made it my go-to choice when traveling, but online its just random, it works in Steam, Netflix, Amazon and Ebay, but doesn't work on Playstation, Epic Store or any betting website, also it doesn't have 3-D secure system implemented with their mastercard which is pretty stupid.


So am looking for the best solution to open a bank account in a foreign country that doesn't put any restriction on how i spent **my** money, 
am not looking for a tax-heaven or anything, just a place to gain more freedom. 

PS:

Am planning to immigrate to either Eastern Europe (Estonia?) or Canada when the time comes, so if you can recommend a country that will make that process easier for me in the future, i would really appreciate it :)

I'm a remote worker who was planning to make my first forays into digital nomadism at Roam Tokyo in April. That's falling through for reasons outside my control, so I'm looking into options in Hong Kong and other cities.

I was wondering if anyone has experience with the co-working/co-living operation called Campfire Home in Hong Kong.

They won't give me contact info of current residents, which I guess makes sense.

That being said, if you know of any equivalents to Roam in Tokyo as far as: being established, a sense of community while not feeling like a hostel or student house, an included coworking space, and nice accommodations - please let me know!

al0ul4,2j7hvwke,Side hustle for digital nomads,"I have a very niche software product for a particular kind of business that I'd like to promote. The trouble is that the customers base is quite small, sometimes even less that 10 potential customers per country. They typically are very difficult to find online though they are easy to spot when you are physically there. Additionally it's a product that impacts heavily on the way they work, therefore it's not very easy to sell even though the advantages over the competition are huge.

Now I cannot expect someone who is an expert in the field to do the actual sale, but I would need someone that finds these businesses and does just a little bit of initial scouting, getting the right contact names and finding out some basic things about what they have in place and their actual size. Additionally I would need some pointers about the culture of the country, business dress code, ease of getting paid and so on. I would pick up from there and visit the pre-screened potential customers.

It would be nice to find local agents but since the potential customer base is limited it's not something that might be of interest to a local, but could be a nice side hustle for digital nomads as would have new markets every time they move.

But would digital nomads be interested in something like this?"

**Background: That pretty blue passport with the eagle comes with a price**

Unlike almost every other country in the world, the United States requires its citizens to file and pay taxes, _even if they don't live in the United States_. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS):

>If you are a U.S. citizen or a U.S. resident alien living in a foreign country, you are subject to the same U.S. income tax laws that apply to citizens and resident aliens living in the United States.

_Wait, so you are saying that even if I move to Mexico tomorrow and live there for the rest of my life, I still need to file a U.S. tax return every year?_

Yes, as long as you earn at least $12,000 per year and you have not renounced your U.S. citizenship. 

_And I still need to pay taxes to the U.S. government?_

Maybe, like everything tax-related, it's complicated.



**Enter the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion**

The Foreign Earned Income Exclusion is a provision of the United States tax code that allows you to exclude income that you earn outside of the United States from your taxable income.

In other words, if you live and make money in another country, you probably still need to file a tax return with the IRS, but you _might*_ not actually have to pay any taxes.

*Your actual tax bill depends on a huge number of factors, including how much money you make, whether you are single or married, and what type(s) of income you have (employee, self-employed, collecting rent, selling assets, etc).

For tax year 2019, the IRS allows taxpayers to exclude up to $105,900 of foreign earned income (for single filers or married couples filing separately; double that for married couples filing together, assuming that they both qualify for the exclusion). 

If you earn less than $105,900, and you earn all of that income while you are outside of the country, then you could **_avoid paying any federal income tax_**.

If you earn more than that amount, then you can still exclude up to $105,900 of foreign earned income. If you are in the top tax bracket of 37%, **_that would reduce your taxes by $39,183_**.

Compare that to the $2,000 tax credit you receive for each child. (Bye-bye baby. Hello Bali!).

But don't go spending all that money just yet...

**How Do You Qualify for the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion?**

The IRS has several ""tests"" that they use to determine whether you can claim the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion. In order to qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion, the IRS requires you to pass the ""Tax Home Test"" and either the ""Bona Fide Residence Test"" or ""the Physical Presence Test"".

There are some other restrictions as well, for example, you need to earn the income outside of the United States (obviously), and income from working abroad as an employee of the U.S. Government does not qualify for either the exclusion.

According to the IRS, in order to pass the Bona Fide Residence test you must be:

>A U.S. citizen who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country, or countries, for an uninterrupted period that includes an entire tax year.

A ""bona fide resident"" means that you legitimately live in the other country, and you can demonstrate your ties to that country (for example: you spend most of your time there, your kids are in school there, you have a driver's license there, you pay taxes to that government, etc). 

It seems clear that if you move out of the United States completely, settle in another country and get a job there, then you would pass the Bona Fide Residence Test and could qualify for the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion. 

Even if you don't move to another country permanently, but you are sent by your employer to work there for an extended, and indefinite period of time, then you could probably still qualify for the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion based on the Bona Fide Residence Test.

**_That all sounds great for expats, but what about digital nomads who aren't moving to one specific country?_**

Most digital nomads probably won't pass the Bona Fide Residence Test, because we do not live in one particular country long enough. Plus, we generally travel on tourist visas, and don't establish formal residency in the countries that we visit.

The alternative to qualifying via the Bona Fide Residence Test is the Physical Presence Test. This is the test that could apply to you as a digital nomad. According to the IRS:

>To meet this test, you must be a U.S. citizen or resident alien who is physically present in a foreign country, or countries, for at least 330 full days during any period of 12 months in a row. A full day means the 24-hour period that starts at midnight.


>To figure 330 full days, add all separate periods you were present in a foreign country during the 12-month period shown… the 330 full days can be interrupted by periods when you are traveling over international waters or are otherwise not in a foreign country.

In other words, you can pass the Physical Presence Test if you are physically present in countries other than the United States for at least 330 days out of a 365 day period. Note that some travel days may not count towards the 330 days. Any days you spend entirely in or over international waters, or any days you leave from or arrive in the United States would not count.

One other thing that's very important to note here, the 330 days are the minimum. If you are only present in a foreign country for 329 days, you don't qualify (except in certain extreme circumstances, like if you had to move due to a war).

So, if you are a digital nomad who spends 330 days or more outside of the United States, you may pass the Physical Presence test. But in order to claim the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, you must also pass the Tax Home Test. This is where it gets a little more complicated. 

To pass the Tax Home test, your tax home must be in a foreign country, or countries, during the time that you earn the income you want to exclude under the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion. 

According to the IRS:


>Your tax home is your regular or principal place of business, employment, or post of duty, regardless of where you maintain your family residence. If you don't have a regular or principal place of business because of the nature of your trade or business, your tax home is your regular place of abode (the place where you regularly live).

>If your abode is in the United States, you will not meet the tax home test and cannot claim the foreign earned income exclusion. The location of your abode is based on where you maintain your family, economic, and personal ties.

Based on all of that, it would seem like digital nomads who are originally from the United States, but now move around from country to country would not be able to claim a foreign tax home, would not pass the Tax Home Test, and would not be able to claim the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion. 

However, the IRS also says:

>If you do not have a regular or main place of business because of the nature of your work, your tax home may be the place where you regularly live. If you have neither a regular or main place of business nor a place where you regularly live, you are considered an itinerant and your tax home is wherever you work.

Taking that ""itinerant"" clause into account, it seems like digital nomads who leave the United States for an indefinite period, spend at least 330 days outside of the United States within twelve months, and travel from place to place while working could pass both the Tax Home Test and the Physical Presence Test and qualify for the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion.

**_But don't I need some underlying business reason to travel to these other countries?_**

No. The IRS does not specify that the nature of your travel must be for business purposes: 

>You can count days you spent in a foreign country for any reason. You do not have to be in a foreign country only for employment purposes. You can count days you spent in a foreign country while on vacation (or for any other purpose) so long as on those days your tax home is still in a foreign country.  

**_Are you sure this is all legal?_**

The Foreign Earned Income Exclusion is completely legal, in the sense that it is part of the United States' tax law, but it's up to you to determine whether or not you qualify to claim the exclusion.

The IRS created a [YouTube video introduction to the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUDOXG4_5-U) and an [online wizard to help you determine if you qualify](https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/can-i-exclude-income-earned-in-a-foreign-country).

**_What's the catch?_**

There is no ""catch"" but there are some considerations that you should be aware of if you decide to claim the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion:

Maintaining your eligibility under the Physical Presence Test severely limits the amount of time you can spend in the United States in a given twelve month period.

Just because you qualify for the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion does not necessarily mean that you don't have to pay any taxes at all. If you are self-employed, or an employee of a United States employer, you may still need to pay social security and medicare taxes. 

You may also need to pay income tax in the country or countries where you are living.

Keep in mind that even if you qualify to exclude your foreign earned income, any money that you earn while in the United States (since the Physical Presence Test does allow you to spend some time in the United States, and the twelve month period that you use to qualify may not line up with the calendar year start and end) is still taxable. Also, not all income qualifies for the exclusion:


>Foreign earned income doesn't include amounts that are actually a distribution of corporate earnings or profits rather than a reasonable allowance as compensation for your personal services. It also doesn't include the following types of income.



*   Pension and annuity income (including social security benefits and railroad retirement benefits treated as social security).
*   Interest, ordinary dividends, capital gains, alimony, etc.

You can find more information about the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion on the [IRS website](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/foreign-earned-income-exclusion-2016) and in [IRS Publication 54](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p54.pdf), ""[Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p54.pdf)"".

**_How can I claim the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion?_**

You can claim the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion on your personal income tax return by filing [IRS Form 2555 Foreign Earned Income](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2555.pdf) ([here are the instructions for that form](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i2555.pdf)).

Alternatively, most of the tax preparation software packages and services, such as [TurboTax](https://turbotax.intuit.com/personal-taxes/self-employment-taxes) and H&R Block also support the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion.

amqwva,txsfv,Just got a third 12-month visa for France -- it's been way easier than I thought," I never read much about getting long-term visas for EU/Schengen countries, so I thought I'd let you all know that getting a long-term French visa might be easier than you think. It has been for me.

Some caveats -- the criteria seem purposefully vague so I don't know why people would be accepted or rejected. FWIW, the clerk processing visa applications in Vancouver said she rarely sees them rejected. Maybe age is a factor? I'm a 41-year-old Canadian. Got my first visa when I was 38 and renewed it while I was in France for a total stay of 24 months, during which time I visited numerous Schengen countries. I just applied for and received another 12-month visa\* this month so I can go back for another year. My girlfriend is French, but this didn't come up in the application process at all (except that I used her parents' home as my first French address).

Being self-employed is definitely not a hindrance. I am a freelance web developer and I was completely forthright about the fact that I work for myself and would continue to do so in France. The only restriction is that you are not allowed to seek or accept work from French companies or clients. I needed to provide a notarized letter stating I would not seek work or work in France. It's hazy to me whether you are also not permitted to have clients elsewhere in the EU, but I played it safe and never attempted this (even after receiving some offers). My clients are now all Canadian, but I had American clients during my first time in France. The official explanations I put on the visa application is that I wanted to visit France to study the language (sort of true, I have become fluent finally and I did spend a lot of time studying my first time there) and to visit as many places in France as possible.

I can speak only for the process here in Canada, but I've read and heard that the application process was similar in the US. In Canada, a company called [VFS](http://www.vfsglobal.com/france/canada/English/index.html) now handles the submission process for visa applications. [They do them in the US as well](http://www.vfsglobal.com/France/usa/english/index.html). Sorry, I don't know for other countries.  
I applied for and received a ""Long-stay visa"" for ""tourist or personal reasons"" -- [https://france-visas.gouv.fr/en\_US/web/france-visas/long-stay-visa](https://france-visas.gouv.fr/en_US/web/france-visas/long-stay-visa)

Part of the application process is proving you have sufficient funds to support yourself in France. I suspect this is the most important part of the application. I don't feel comfortable sharing personal finances publicly, but I have read and heard that you need to show 1,000 Euros per month of savings and/or income. That seems low to me, TBH. You could barely pay rent on a decent apartment for that amount in some places in France. I had to submit bank records, plus I submitted a bunch of invoices to show my average monthly earnings.

I needed medical insurance that would pay for repatriation. That was easy to find.

I needed to show I had lodgings for the first 3 months. The first application, I used my gf's parents' home. This time, we had rented an Airbnb and I just had to make sure my Airbnb name matched the one in my passport. Also, they really want to see every day within the 3 months accounted for. We had one weekend where we were going to go away somewhere and I got an email from the visa processing company that they couldn't submit my application until I filled that gap. Bing-bang-boom and I booked a weekend in Nice, emailed the reservation to them and that was fine.  
The clerk told me it could take up to 4 weeks to process the visa. I got mine back in 7 business days, even though they send them from Vancouver to Montreal now for processing.

Now I'm going to France again! I love it there. My gf and I lived in Lille and Paris and I can't wait to start every day with a pain au chocolat and end it with French wine or Belgian beer. And to have the rest of Europe at my fingertips for another 12 months is incredible! I really hope to see more of Germany and Portugal this time around.  
I can't think of anything else, but I'm happy to answer any questions. I can only speak to my experience, but I have to say that getting these visas has been WAY easier than expected.

&#x200B;

\*the first visa you get is technically only for 6 months, but you just make an appointment when you get to France to fill out some more paperwork, have a medical examination and pay some more money to get the full 12 months. I actually got 13 months the first time because they extended my visa 30 days while I had to wait for my medical exam appointment"
amsbc2,21qlxgzx,"Solution for getting 2FA SMS, hosting SIM card","I know this comes up a bit. Google Voice, Skype or any other virtual number cannot get certain incoming SMS for 2FA due to the number being a VOIP number or the verification SMS being a short code which do not deliver on VOIP numbers. Theres no workaround for this on those type of numbers, also yes you should probably avoid 2FA via SMS but some companies have no other options.

&#x200B;

Has anyone used a SIM hosting service? Basically send your existing SIM card to a company within your country to hookup to receive SMS(via email or app) so it acts like it's still in the country and not roaming? For example you have Verizon w/o expensive international plan and leaving the country for 6 months. Instead of having no service to receive SMS and just being locked out of your Bank account you send your SIM to be hosted temporarily and still get all your calls and SMS normally even the Bank 2FA SMS code.

T-mobile does have a payg plan for $3/month, so even grabbing a new phone number to use solely for 2FA SMS would work and that would allow Whatsapp verification since it's a Tmobile number.

I know some countries have better hostels than others, some countries have better pricing and more choices on airbnb than others and some countries have an entirely different website that foreigners might not know exist (with most likely better pricing).


I prefer to spend at least a month in each new location so I usually try to find posts on airbnb that offer a monthly discount (if I don't find a pet sit in that location which is something I also often try to do via another website). But I know there must be other options besides airbnb across the world. 


Sorry if this is a dumb question but it's worth asking in my opinion. :)

anlusx,perpm,Legalities of riding a scooter without a license in SEA,"I know I can just pay a ""fine.""

My issue is actually with insurance. AFAIK, no insurance company on Earth (or at least in Oz) will cover you unless you have a valid license in the country you're riding in for that specific type of vehicle.

Most insurance providers require a valid motorbike license in your home country AND your destination country. Others, however, only ask for valid car license from your home country and a valid license in your destination country for a scooter 50cc or less. In my case, and I'm sure for many others, I don't have a motorbike license but would still like to be covered.

My question is: do most country's, especially in SEA, require a special motorbike license to ride a scooter 50cc or less? Or is an international drivers license (for a car) legally acceptable to ride a scooter?

Obviously, it depends on the country in question. Maybe someone knows about the rules for Indonesia, Thailand, etc where riding scooters is super common. Or where would you even go about finding this info (obviously, you can't trust the scooter renting companies)?

I know a lot of people probably don't consider this, but it's super important. Not having a license during a scooter accident is actually the most common rejected travel insurance claim.

Obviously, for most accidents, you can just pay out of pocket. But a big one that needs brain surgery or a medical evac would be the end of me, and probably most people here. "

anm1a2,perpm,Australian Tax Residency as a DN,"The ATO's definition of tax residency is super vague and confusing so I thought I'd share my experience. 

FWIW, I already qualify as someone who's ""cut ties"" with Australia as I've been an expat for the last 7 years. I got no assets here, no permant address, etc. Therefore, my situation is probably way different from most people here. 

My accountant and the ATO believe I'll probably be a non-resident for tax purposes as a digital nomad. 

The ATO themselves told me I don't necessarily have to settle permanently in a particular place, so long as I don't reside here and have left Australia permanently (interestingly enough, permanently refers to my current perception at this point in time. I can always change my mind and come back to Australia. I could also just consider my trip temporary which counts towards being classified as an Australian tax-resident).

They also didn't seem too fussed that I wouldn't be paying tax anywhere as I'm moving around, which appears to contradict the ""you have to pay tax somewhere"" line of thinking. I guess that means I'm one of those ""stateless"" and therefore untaxable people.

Another interesting point is they consider Australian income to be that which is generated from a company incorporated in Australia. So if I work exclusively for an Aussie company, I'm much better off retaining my Australia tax residency, because foreign tax residents don't get the 18k tax free threshold and also pay a higher rate on all Australian income.

Of course, even the ATO call centre doesn't necessarily know the rules. Nothing is for certain until they decide to audit you and make a decision on your tax residency themselves. Some great advice from my accountant is to have the money at hand to pay off your tax debt in these situations.

Nevertheless, the ATO helpline is actually pretty helpful and they only take a few mins to answer. Best of all, they're free!"

anzswr,f2wxs4h,The darker side of my start as a DN,"American. Late 20s. I have another handle that I post here with, but it's too obviously tied in with my website/real identity/career for a post like this.

&#x200B;

I dropped out of academia, applied for jobs without success, and took up freelance writing in travel. Unusually, I had extensive experience in points hacking that made me attractive to certain websites.  While this dried up, I was able to build a portfolio/reputation that let me move forward, at a glacial pace.

&#x200B;

I could never really land a W-2 job.  We can talk about it (or take pot shots at me, if you're so inclined) all day long, but (my branch of) PoliSci isn't an attractive degree.  Even with overseas experience and all that good stuff.  Likewise, freelancing didn't come close to covering a decent life in the US (I mean rent, food, gym membership, a glass of wine on Friday - we're not even talking about stocking an IRA, saving for a down payment, or health insurance).  The taxation disadvantages of being a US-resident 1099 are well-trodden paths I needn't explore in this post, I think.

&#x200B;

I was also isolated.  Freelancing, even if you are working, is tantamount to being unemployed in the US.  I felt guilty spending money going out, so I didn't (very often...).  Also, freelance writing is a rather solitary occupation.

&#x200B;

Going (back) overseas allowed me to naturally stretch the dollar much further, and to my enormous shock, I became a more attractive candidate for clients seeking travel writers. I left in Spring 2018. My wordsmithing didn't improve dramatically between April and June, yet...I won substantially higher prestige clients, like Thrillist.

&#x200B;

And yet it's really not enough.  To scale, I'd need either a small coterie of clients with incessant content needs or a much broader stable of clients who need pieces here and there. Some months are dire. December/January and June/July are particularly awful.  This is treading water, not laying the (financial) groundwork for a stable future.

&#x200B;

Now don't get me wrong. This lifestyle has brought me to places I'd otherwise not have the time for as a ""normal"" (overworked, overburdened, time-impoverished) American tourist. I've also had the opportunity to visit old friends and see new places.

&#x200B;

Somehow, I don't think that I'm the only one. When I see posts on here talking about where they can go on (sub-$2k) per month,  I know some of these people are other Americans, Canadians, Aussies, Kiwis, Brits, etc avoiding having to exist on housing project wages.  This doesn't get talked about here, but I can't be the only one. Hell, multiple DNs on the road have confided in me along similar lines. Maybe it's more fitting for r/lostgeneration than here.

&#x200B;

A close friend once accurately summarized my move as ""brave or desperate."" He wasn't wrong.

Digital Nomads - the definition of such has been a topic of debate here. But to me, a digital nomad has to be working, after all true nomads moves to follow resources and thus earn a living along the way. A digital nomad to me stays somewhere for weeks to months and intends to do it semi-permanently, probably a couple years.

US$1 = 8,580; £1=11,000; €1 = 9700; 100THB = 27,400

USD, THB widely accepted alongside local currency. However, the trend is on the long-term decline as the Lao government has aggressively promoted the Kip to ""de-dollarize"" the economy.  Sellers can and will be quite picky about the crispiness/quality of any baht or dollars you try to spend.

&#x200B;

**Food**: Highly similar to northern Thai - laab (larb), curry, fried rice/noodle, ""salad,"" noodle soup barbecue meat, and fruit seems to be the core menu.  Specialities include local sausage, various dips (smoky eggplant dip, a bit like a Lao baba ghanoush, is delicious).

&#x200B;

**Cost**: Cheaper than a Western country, but expensive for SE Asia.  You'll find that you're paying more and getting less for an equivalent good/service that you'd buy in Thailand or Vietnam. This seems to be in line with ""James' Law"" that once one goes below a certain point in economic/infrastructure development, costs for Westerners/visitors increase.   A case in point, my US$50/nt hotel room was a very basic, albeit clean and comfortable.  The fixtures were very much ""economy class""  and the breakfast a modest affair. Construction quality gets the job done - barely...soundproofing -\_-.   In Thailand, a savvy traveler can get a nice 4\* property with a pool and gym for that money.

&#x200B;

Water - approx 3000 kip for a 500mL bottle, 5-6000 for 1.5L (shop) or 8k and 10k+ at a restaurant, respectively. 

Beer - From 8,000 for a small beerlao (330mL) and 10,000 for a big one (640mL)

Food: Most Lao dishes run 20,000-60,000 kip depending on venue  - this applies to spring rolls, curries, BBQ meat, fried rice, noodles, and dessert. A western breakfast falls in the same range, typically. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Accommodation**: (February, or high season, prices) Hostel bed $8-10, 2-2.5\* guesthouse $20-35,  3\* guesthouse/small hotel $45-70, 4\* hotel $75+   You'll note that accommodation options are heavily skewed towards the short term. Even airbnb is largely just another booking channel for the hotels/guesthouses/hostels.

&#x200B;

**Internet**: Famously bad, but not abysmal (from a writer's perspective...). I found the best connection came from tethering to my phone. I opted for a 15gb package from Unitel at the airport, but I think I was a bit short-changed. Ahem.   I would not come here if I were dependent on multi-GB sized files, an avid online gamer, or needed quality video-calling.

&#x200B;

**Working spots:**  No co-working options. Cafes are quite decent and all of them offered wifi. I was fond of Joma and Saffron.

&#x200B;

**Sightseeing**: Limited.  There are the local temples, Kuang Si waterfalls, and roaming the countryside.  You can relax and focus on projects here, assuming the internet isn't a deal-breaker.

If you somehow don't know what a sales funnel is, it's basically a series of web pages that are designed to get the user to do something: fill out their contact information, make a purchase, etc. A landing page (or lead capture page) is part of a sales funnel, generally the first part.

Basically the bird's eye view is like this:

1. Lead capture page (gives something away in exchange for contact info)
2. Bridge page (""pre-sells"" the user for the sales page)
3. Sales page - sells stuff
4. OTO Upsell - One time offer (""You just spent $100 on something, do you want to spend $1000 on this other thing that's better?""
5. OTO Downsell - One time offer (""You did/didn't spent $1000 on that other thing, maybe you want to spend $27 on this other thing that's still really cool?"")
6. Thank you page - self explanatory

That's the gist of it. Obviously I'm not going to be banging out 5000 word epic sales pages for free, but I'm happy to build you something that converts. I can help you with FB ad copy as well. 

Here's an example of one of my own funnels so you can see what I'm talking about:

Landing page: https://www.lightningfunnels.com/pro-funnels-free-training

Bridge page: https://www.lightningfunnels.com/go-to-next-page	

Sales page: https://www.lightningfunnels.com/funnel-training-with-bonuses

some countries in EU such as Bulgaria or Romania offer a pretty attractive tax scheme, but there is always this point: the 183 days rule.

\- how strict is it? Do I really risk not being considered a tax resident in, for example, Bulgaria, if I spend there something like 160 days instead of 183?

aqoqgz,13g11r,What do Canadians do before leaving for their nomadic life?,"If you had a full career, 'typical' adult life before departing Canada, what steps did you take before leaving as a full-time nomad?

Some of the below applies to nomads hopping from country to country while other questions are more relevant to nomads building home bases in singular countries.  I would assume fresh university grads would rightly ignore some of the below but there are a lot of questions to be asked as the rules and tools frequently change.

Things to consider before and after leaving would be:

* **Keeping your status as a Canadian resident**: did you keep 'primary' ties (such as a house or car) or 'secondary' ties (such as a bank account)? I assume most would maintain Canada as their country of residence due to difficulty establishing residency elsewhere.  Longer-term nomads might take the time to build permanent residency or citizenship status in the country of their choice.
* **Figuring out domestic investments**: what did you do with your TFSA and registered stock holdings? Did you plan to continue contributing to your various Canadian holdings while away or did you create separate accounts for any foreign investments?
* **Housing**: did you sell your house (if you owned) or did you continue renting it out and use a management company?
* **Government programs**: did you continue to receive government checks auto-deposited into your bank accounts, such as child benefits, GST rebates etc.?
* **Health care coverage**: did you proactively cancel/pause your health care coverage, such as OHIP for Ontario residents? In Ontario, you can have an exemption for 2 years but it's complicated and requires a permanent address
* **Drivers license:** with a current address required on your license, what did you do with your provincial driver's license?  Many would love to keep it in order to rent cars while abroad
* **Taxes**: did you continue to file annually after being outside of the country? How did you structure your income from your DN payments (ie. incorporation)?
* **Other things to consider**, such as getting the right bank account, saving your phone number, a no foreign transaction credit card (I prefer Home Trust) and having a Canadian address on file

I have been in and out of the country in the last few years (currently in Mexico) and would love to hear how people made life easier in general and stayed on the right side of the CRA.

What tips, tricks and legal recommendations do my fellow Canadians have?  And what mistakes did you make in hindsight?"

ard5q8,38gydocw,What is your housing and internet situation in Vietnam?," 

Hey guys,

I'm considering returning to Hoi An, Da Nang, or somewhere within the vicinity-- this time as an online teacher. I'm currently teaching online in the US and the platform requires high speed internet: it's a game-like platform. I haven't experimented yet in Hoi An. For those heavily dependent on (high-speed) internet in Vietnam ...

\-Have you found that your internet really depends on the specific AirBnB or the greater neighborhood?

\-Do you currently use any type of gadgets like pocket wifi-- is it reliable-- rental or purchased?

\-How do you go about telling Airbnb hosts that you plan to do work in their home (and ask about wifi speed)-- like certain wifi speed tests? I've heard, in some cases AirBnB hosts are highly skeptical of anyone working from their home-- what has been your experience? Do you have a set of specific questions you ask?

\-Are you renting via AirBnBs or staying in apartments? 6 month visa, return and leave?

I'm specifically looking for Vietnam and Hoi An answers, as I'm familiar with internet experiences in China, Japan and other parts of Asia. I last visited Vietnam in 2012, but was not heavily focused on internet specifics as I was taking a short one-month course. The program was affiliated with a housing agent who lined us up with cheap, short-term apartments."
ardyst,16cavi,Programming in C# and or python - How good do you really have to be to work remotely?,"I've asked this question in programming forums and it seems to get shot down pretty quick by people telling me I need a CS degree and 10 years experience to even consider it, but I'm curious to know the thoughts of people who support the DN lifestyle and understand that I'm not looking to make $100k a year or make big corporate moves. This is about simplifying, rather than growing financially. My life at home is set up, and will still be here when we return. I essentially just need to be sustainable in a SE asian country.

I have a little experience in c# and python and currently work for a LiDAR company that supports my efforts to learn software dev and I'm working towards a jnr dev position with them that I can take remote one day. If that fails, I am curious to know how good you actually have to be to pick up enough money to live whilst working remotely.

I have a few other skills and have worked professionally as a graphic designer and drafter, but programming is what I am really enjoying currently and I have a couple of years to learn it on the job where I can dedicate a few hours a day (on average) to learning development. I enjoy this work and I would like to make the career change into this field, but working remotely is part of our plan going forward and I have a couple of years or so to make it work before we make the jump.

So, to any developers in this forum that work remotely, can I get your honest opinion and or experiences.

\- How experienced are you?

\- How much experience is realistic to gain an entry level remote position, even subcontracting through upwork etc. (Which I'm probably already skilled enough to pick up some basic jobs, but haven't chased them)

\- Do you subcontract or have an employer?

\- Pitfalls, what to watch out for etc.

\- How many hours a week do you work? Do you have any moments of unemployment/ in between jobs.

Basically, we an American couple in are early 30s and make a full-time living online with our own businesses. After all things paid (taxes, insurance, savings etc,) we're netting around 8k a month (this jumps to almost 20k a few months a year do to our seasonal businesses). Currently we're living in Southern California paying north of 2k a month for our small 1bedroom.

Our lease is ending in a 3 months so we want to peace out and find a lower COL area. Our situation: we don't know if we want to head to a new state (Oregon, Idaho, Tennessee are currently in our sights) or screw it all and head to Europe (not interested in Asia as I know this is a popular destination here).

We've been lucky to travel to Europe a lot, but have never stayed there long-term. We are aware of a few places who's visa we think we'd be interesting in obtaining. Another thing, we'd like to think about having kids. 

Places we've looked: Netherlands, France, Italy, Poland, Czechia, Romania (and if anyone else know of a place to obtain a visa as Americans?).

We like outdoors, Greenery, trails, hiking, food, etc., but most importantly, cheaper COL as we'd like to save for a home here in the future and internet is a must. 

I'm curious to hear from others who were maybe in a situation like this and what they ended up deciding? How did you list the pros and cons to make a choice?

 Sorry if this seems incomplete, as you can tell I'm a bit just unsure about how to proceed. The prospect of paying 500 euros a month for a place at some of those locations listed above is very appealing to us. 

More info can be given for help. "

asi5jp,2nri05sx,DN-ers/Coders - Are most of you web developers?,"Hi all - aspiring DN-er here.  I've been perusing this subreddit in hopes of forming ideas about potential career directions for a DN lifestyle (i.e. telecommuting, skill set ubiquity).  From what I can observe, it appears that most software folks work in two basic categories:

\- web development (the seemingly vast majority)  
\- data science/engineering

As far as realistic goals go, achieving DN-ism through becoming a web developer seems to be the most promising.  Data science/engineering seems to require an unusual amount training, knowledge, and entrepreneurship for just a handful of high-end jobs.  I'm certainly not qualified for data science, but I would like to take my career in a data-y direction.  I have a substantial amount of experience in hands-on analytical chemistry, and I am currently training myself to automate laboratory functioning through building macros/VBA/python.  So I guess I would have more of a skill set in data analysis/processing/visualization and honing laboratory workflow.   I'm not yet sure if those skills can be realistically applied to a DN career path.

So, ultimately, I'm hoping to get a better sense of the diversity of software-oriented jobs out there, or confirm my original thinking regarding web development as a realistic choice.  I would like to tailor my career direction to my strengths, but not at the expense of practicality.   Thanks for chiming in!"

asqsjj,39i7frht,My first month as a digital nomad...,"I am not a newbie in the online industry... I am from the Philippines and back at home, working online is such a blessing to most of our countrymen. I guess it's a mutual benefit between the ""clients"" overseas and ""us"" back there... We earn more they spend less... I guess that's why it was such a great opportunity... While many people (and I'm not here to argue or create a debate) hated us because of the ""low price"" that we could offer, I believe we were able to help many businesses leverage as well.   


I worked in a call center industry so I did Telemarketing as my opening gate in the online world. However, what I really wanted to do is something that is more exciting than Telemarketing and cold calling (I'm sure some who will read this knows the deal and it's frustrating) but again, it's an opportunity so why not... Anyways, so I work my way to finding other online opportunities that don't involve cold calls (research, skip trace, etc.,) and boom! I was hired by a Digital Marketing Company for Social Media Lead Generation. The owners, they claimed to love traveling and so I was really excited to join the company. They visited us in the Philippines, and in a few months, the company grew, I became a Team Leader, and woah! we're living with them here in Thailand. BUT... That's not the start of my nomadic journey I should say... This month is the real start...

I am excited and nervous at the same time but here I am...  "
ass52l,15n3ni,Quitting the Digital Nomad Life,"(1.2 years on the 'road') 

Do you ever feel that flying to one city after the other, coming off as a bit shallow? Anytime real issues arise, I'm just going to bypass the feeling by booking the next place and being 'on the move'. 

&#x200B;

Additionally, my biggest gripe about solo digital nomadism is lack of community. I'm always just 'passing by' people. The advantage of digital nomadism is to go anywhere. The disadvantage is that I live nowhere. It's not a bad thing, per se, but the lifestyle is unrelatable to everyone that I meet. And I'm feeling more and more isolated as time goes by.

&#x200B;

To remedy, I decided to settle in LA. There's a bunch of good adult night classes. It's an automatic community learning with other people.

ati4di,4rfx1n2,"Heading to Chiang Mai with my family, where should we stay + for how long?","Howdy, I’m currently staying in Penang and heading to Thailand in April , a week in Phuket, a week in Koh Lanta and then the plan is to go to Chiang Mai for 6 months. 
I’m travelling with my wife and 3 year old daughter and wanted to ask you all which areas of Chiang Mai would be good places to stay. Also which apartment buildings are good in those areas.
The plan is to get an airbnb for the first week, and spend that time checking out the different areas and potential apartments but it’d be good to get a head start. 
We‘re looking for an area that is good for a family rather than party people. Ideally the local area would have play park/s, nice veggie/vegan eateries & a nice co-working space within walking distance but I’m quite happy to get Grab taxis everywhere. 
For an apartment we want clean & modern with facilities such as pool, gym and play area, if it was serviced as well that would be awesome- we got a taste of that in KL and loved it! But then who wouldn’t!

If I could get a place for 20,000 THB then happy days! But if it cost double that then thats fine. 

I’ve been reading other posts about Chiang Mai since writing the above and it has put me off a bit tbh, I’m sure its still cool for many reasons and I’d still to visit but it does seem like it might be a bit wank-y and I’m wondering if 6 months will be too long to stay there and should we just do 3 months and then go somewhere else in Thailand/Asia for 3 months. Anyone got any opinions on that they want to share? 

In terms of socialising I would like to meet other app developers, I’m self taught and worked remotely through Upwork for about 3 years and have never met another app developer to talk about work shit with 😢. My wife & I would also like to meet other families with kids of a similar age."

atjmok,4rfx1n2,Eighth month if being a digital nomad,"Me & me fams have been DNing all over the damn shop since May 31st 2018, I posted this that evening : https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/8nuj77/first_day_if_being_a_digital_nomad/?st=JSG59Y5O&sh=2bd10c8c

Here’s an update for anyone who is interested. It’s a bit stream of consciousness / note-y but I think it’s readable. 

There’s been times I’ve regretted our decision but mostly I’ve been glad we did it and its been a while since I’ve regretted it. We have made some mistakes along the way & wasted some money but on the whole its been a great experience.

Here’s where we’ve been (in order): Umbria & Pisa in Italy, Seville, Ronda in Spain, Casablanca & Essaouira in Morocco, back to England, Llandovery in Wales, Alicante & Barcelona in Spain, London Heathrow, , Johannesburg in South Africa, Hong Kong in China, Kuala Lumpur & Penang in Malaysia, currently in Penang, heading up to Thailand in April : Phuket, Koh Lanta & Chiang Mai.

Favourite City: Penang  (& Seville)
Least favourite: Casablanca 

Favourite Tourist Place: Safari in Kruger Park, SA, also Cradle of humankind in SA - not so much the museum but just being in the area and feeling that connection to our early ancestors was really cool.

Favourite Cultural thing: Thaipusam in Penang - it was happening the weekend we arrived, didn’t know anything about before but really fun and interesting to be there and join in with smashing coconuts and talking with the people - great food as well.

Favourite weather: Seville, crazy hot but a dry heat, kinda like walking around in a oven, I might be a bit sick enjoying that it reminded me of my time as a chef working in a hot kitchen but without all the stress and hard work!

Biggest Mistakes: Not planning enough, not researching where we’re going enough, thinking we had lots of money because I did relative to my personal financial history and so spending too freely early on, not working enough sometimes and then having to work too much other times to make up for it, thinking that accommodation would be cheap in places because the cheapest places on airbnb were really cheap. Stressing out a bit early on and being a bit negative and passing that stress on to my wife. 

Smaller Mistakes: Not paying extra in advance to be able to change dates of flights, not buying multi-region plug converters before we left because I thought it’d be cheaper to buy USB plugs locally. 

Best decisions: Doing it in the first place,  Saving lots of money before leaving, leaving Morocco early to regroup & see family again before making the bigger journey to SA & Asia. Using Revolut app.

If I was to do it again: I would stay in the UK until September/October and gotten a head start on my own products (I’m an app dev) as I already had a good amount saved and I think that would have worked out better, also the bastards back home had the best summer in decades once we’d gone! I would also skip Morocco and see more of Europe. That’s very subjective though so more objectively: I’d pick a bunch of potential destinations and write a little fact file for each including climate over the year, cost of living, cultural differences and also a pros and cons list. Then compare them to decide where & when to go and not to go. Also give more thought to how much time & money I would want to spend on travelling between places and the pros & cons of changing homes frequently compared to staying in homes for longer periods of time. Also I might do a couple of trial runs visiting a country and doing a few cities in a week travelling by train. 

As I’ve mentioned we didn’t plan or research much, we had a loose idea of where we wanted to go and was quite happy to wing it, once we got going this freaked me out a bit and I felt like we had messed up, but conversely when we had been a bit more well planned we then changed our plans and lost money on non-refundable accommodation and flights. 

Things that have been really great: Tasty food, living in nicer homes than I could afford in the UK, seeing my daughter experiencing different places & cultures and gaining the understanding that their are different countries and they are spread out over the earth, seeing her play with other kids from different countries and who speak different languages and get along. The weather, I’ve basically been in summer for the best part of a year now. Those moments when I remember how awesome it is that we’re able to do this. Living and working in all these different places and that just being my life now. Meeting people who I otherwise who never have met and just chatting for a short time in a bar or cafe or taxi and a year ago we were on opposite sides of the world. The things are ridiculously cheap compared to back home that we can buy without caring about the cost. 

Most useful apps: Revolut, Google Translate, Airbnb, Skyscanner, Rome2Rio, Grab, Find Friends (for us to keep an eye on each other when we’re apart)

That’s probably enough! Thanks for reading, I hope it was at least a little interesting.

I do not need a foreign bank account, so this should greatly simplify things. For the past couple years I've been engaged in automated trading and have been reporting the gains under my personal income (US citizen). I've amassed more than enough to live comfortably, and would like to carry out all future trading without worrying about immediate tax implications.

As I understand it, with an offshore company I'm allowed to trade company-controlled funds as much as I want without incurring any personal tax liabilities. Only when the company pays me (i.e. money/property is transferred to my personal holdings) do I report taxable income, and this would be taxed at the regular income tax rate.

My questions are the following:

* Which country is optimal? The initial incorporation cost does not matter to me as much as minimizing annual fees, and finding a 0% tax rate.
* Is it possible to incorporate on my own (through a government website?), or do I have to pay a lawyer? If so, who should I trust, and what is a reasonable rate?
* Is my understanding of how this would work correct? Can I simply create separate accounts (exchange accounts and crypto wallets) for this company and then send money to them? And as long as I don't send anything back to my personal wallets, or use company money to pay someone on my behalf, I don't need to report anything to the IRS?
* Do I have to report anything to the IRS when I create the company?
* Can I still use my personal US-based computer to run the trading bots? I don't see why not.

Any help is much appreciated! Happy to tip crypto for advice (if that's allowed).

This would be off the back of a year of intense traveling through Europe and Australia, so this would be like a holiday for me so a beach is a must. Also, Australia would not be an option for visa reasons and Europe could be an issue thanks to Brexit but should be okay.

I have a UK passport and I would be flying from Sydney at the end of September.

Important:

· Beach

· Cheap

· Fast internet

Thanks for all your help guys!"
avda40,,About to leave Berlin. Where should I go?,"Berlin has caused me nothing but problems since the day that I got here. 

Let’s talk about the fact that in Germany there are literally so many laws that you can’t even go into the library without removing your laptop and putting it in a bag to get into the door.

The Wi-Fi is horrible almost everywhere and people don’t really seem to care that the Wi-Fi is horrible.

You have to use cash almost everywhere and people don’t seem to know how to use credit cards and they certainly will never know what bitcoin is.

Overall I find that the German culture is very pessimistic and risk averse and it’s hard to be in entrepreneur in that environment.

Tallinn, Estonia

I’ve heard good things about Estonia. I like that they have e-residency and are technologically advanced. I’m not sure what it’s like living there but I would be interested to hear if anyone has experience doing so.

Stockholm, Sweden

I think Swedish culture is much different than German culture and I think it’s more entrepreneurial. I see a lot of events on Eventbrite related to product design marketing e-commerce. I also like the music scene in the fashion scene in Sweden. After all Axwell and the Swedish House Mafia are from there.

London, United Kingdom

So many people talk about the cost of living in London but isn’t it worth it. Considering it’s a financial capital in Europe aren’t there benefits to paying more to get access to big brands and robust infrastructure.

I’m not sure what the weathers like but I’d be curious to know if anyone has an opinion about London for 2019.

Elsewhere in Europe

Are there any other hubs in Europe that are up-and-coming where e-commerce brands and start ups are thriving.

Canada

I’ve heard good things about Vancouver and Toronto the weather is certainly better position for climate change. Would anyone recommend the cities and if so why would you recommend them for 2019?

avdk49,,Is not a good time to go to London?,"Simply put... is now a good time to go to London?

The reason I asked this question is based upon the economic changes happening globally.

I’ve been so busy I honestly haven’t had the time to even research what Brexit really is but I hear it’s not good.

I came from the US and I don’t see it getting better over there anytime soon. The debt ceiling is going through the roof and banks are not going to be able to repay it.

So with a recession looming in the US and potentially UK does it actually make sense to go to London right now and what are the specific reasons why or why not?

This post is really for world travelers, economists, financial experts, investors and people who really know what’s going on globally with the economy and specifically how that relates to the UK."

I can easily bring my laptop for working. I have 4G and I can extend my battery for the day with battery packs. I can bring a portable chair. I can bring a thermos with coffee and some snacks.

But how do I get a proper working table with me???

I have scanned through countless folding and camping tables, but nothing seems to work. The tables are either too bulky (Yes, it folds... to a surface area of 1m2. Good luck putting that to a backpack). Alternatively, a table does fold to a small size, but is only 70cm tall. This works well for kids, very short people, and for short-term use for e.g. a lunch. But try using one for an entire day as an average-height person, and I can guarantee your neck and shoulders are very much in pain the next day.

Because we don't have a permanent address, we also don't have renters insurance — the only thing insured right now is our car. I messaged Airbnb (and maybe this was naive to think) but they don't offer any sort of protection or insurance for guests, only for hosts.

aww7zz,r1tqhwl,Struggling Digital Nomad: How do I scale my Income and get more Clients?,"Long story short I'm a 21YO digital nomad who's been traveling south east asia for four months. I left home with no contacts and real clients and have made it this far with a bit of money in the bank.  I absolutely love this lifestyle and have made friends for a lifetime. Now however it's time for me to focus on my hustle and scale my income.

&#x200B;

**My Skills:**

* Content writing in WordPress, Online business Niche.
* Recently got into copy writing but haven't got any high paying client yet.

  
**Income**:

Last month I made USD$800 and worked around 20 hours a week

&#x200B;

I am currently working full-time and am now looking to scale this income. However, the frequency of work is not as much as I like and am proactively looking for more (high paying clients)

&#x200B;

**What's the problem?**

I had a few goals before I started traveling 1) To scale my blog and 2) To scale my income to $2000 and I've not achieved either one. In fact, my income last month has been the same as that when I started freelancing though I worked qutie less.

&#x200B;

The problem is 90% of my clients have been through Reddit and I've not actively looked for them elsewhere but now that I have all this free time I realize that I have so much free time and can make so much more money -- but I don't have enough clients to give me that frequency.

&#x200B;

So the solution? Get more clients right?

&#x200B;

That's what I'm trying to figure out right now. I realize I need to get more creative than look for clients on r/ForHire sub-reedits

&#x200B;

My goal for the next two months is double my income and tap into $2000. Any recommendations on different ways I can get more copy/content writing clients?

Working on my project in front of a beautiful view of nature, of course as long as I have access to the internet, is a great thing and one that I'm focusing on. Doing it as a step-by-step without assurance that my plan will succeed is a scary thing and because I'm the first in the family including relatives in both sides to do this.

Are there any other opportunity that could guide me on this? Or something that I still haven't know yet that I should look into?

Looking to spend May and June in Chile testing out the nomad life for a bit with my boyfriend (who will be on time off before starting a new job in July). We already have round-trip tickets in and out of Santiago but beyond that nothing is planned. We're ideally looking for places that have access to beautiful hiking but still have reliable wi-fi for the majority of our time there. 

So far we've looked into and are considering:

* Flying down to Balmaceda to be in the Coyhaique area to hike a 4-5 day trek in Patagonia in early May before it gets too cold while I can take a week off, and we're thinking Cerro Castillo is our best option given the time of year. 
* Spending a week or two in the Cajon del Maipo region outside of Santiago to be in nature and near hiking (anyone have any experience staying in San Alfanso, perhaps? How was the connectivity in the accommodations available? Are we better off staying closer to the metro area and doing weekend trips to hike versus being in the mountains?)
* Finishing up in Valparaiso for a bit to check out the coast then spend a few days in the capital before flying home (are there better towns on the coast west of the capital to check out instead of Valparaiso?)

&#x200B;

We'll be there in May/June so we realize the weather will start to turn more from autumn into true winter but don't have much interest in winter sports, just hiking and being in nature.

I want to join the digital nomad movement. I’m in my mid twenties, debt free, with 40k in the bank and 10 years coding experience. I’ve started working on my own, and I’m realizing that there is SO much to do beyond coding and I’m very, very bad at it. I need to develop these skills and I’ve never learned anything faster than by being around people who are better at it than me.

So I got to thinking...maybe I should go to Bali / Chiang Mai / wherever and get right into the thick of it. Bring my macbook, sign up for a coworking space, and work alongside the people who are leading the movement (I think). 

But I have a concern about these areas and their coworking spaces...are they just a trap for suckers and wannabe digital nomads like me? I’m hoping to find people I can learn from, like the people I’ve seen online who inspire me. If the only people there are brand new entrepreneurs because everyone else knows not to spend $200 a month on a glorified coffee shop, then maybe I ought to stay at home. 

Also, this is all based off my assumption that coworking spaces in these nomad heavy areas are the main hub for interaction between nomads. Is it actually something else? Perhaps people rely on online interaction after all? Or maybe meetups?

So...is heading to one of these nomad hubs and joining a coworking space my best option to get up to my neck in the community, or am I better off doing something else?"

Has anyone else experienced this? The place has 40+ ratings, 5-star average, nothing but positive reviews for both the home and the host.

Also I don't want to waste my spare time at home on the computer or whatever. I want to actually do stuff, I just don't know what. Advice? Suggestions?

Any piece of advice of any kind would be appreciated as well.

Thank you in advance!"

aygnoy,tyh7h,Could I use my engineering degree to be a DN? Do non software DN positions pay well?,"About to finish up my degree in civil engineering, minor in economics. Id really want to give being a DN a try. I had an interview recently with a company that offered a remote position and the internship was basically project estimation and sales. I didn't get the job but nonetheless I am now really interested in having this freedom of being able to work remotely.


Unfortunately, pure engineering that isn't software typically doesnt lend itself to remote work or even work from home. However all my previous internships have been more related to construction project management and it's had more to do with business and dealing with projects so I feel I could make that transition if I really try. 

But I'm wondering are there even any that many remote jobs really in the 'business' side of things? Also do non software positions even pay that well? All I hear about are these English teaching, copywriting and odd jobs, all of which pay little and would be terrible imo if you want to be a DN. 


So yeah, what are your thoughts on this?"

ayv04s,,Does my employer need to know exactly where I am?,"Hello!  First time poster and I hope this is OK to post in this sub and I apologize for the length:

&#x200B;

I'm employed full time for a US-based company on a fully disbursed team.  We are a small team of 5 people and I have been with the company for 2 years.  We have no headquarters and for the first year of his employment, one of our devs worked out of an RV with his family - so traveling is not prohibited.

&#x200B;

I am required to work 9-5 EST, as I do customer support and the timing is important.  Although I generally am at one home base location, I have worked while overseas 3 times and never had any issues with time zones, connectivity, productivity, etc.

&#x200B;

Each time I have worked from overseas, I find that my boss makes comments about how it ""must be nice"" to be in whichever locale I am in, and will even mention that I am in another country when we are on calls with clients, etc.  He will never expressly say that this type of travel is frowned upon and has never had an issue with my performance.  Its just the petty comments which are unnerving.

&#x200B;

Thus, my question: does my boss need to know where in the world I am?  I always have a coworker update my IP address to access our DB if I need it, so I don't really see any reason why my boss would need to know if I am in my house, at a Starbucks up the street or in a hotel in Milan.  "

Is it even possible when you're on a typical nomad path?

&#x200B;

There are distributed companies -- in tech I'm aware of some like Automattic and Buffer, which boast of having employees around the world. But the key is, *the founders aren't nomads*. Few of the employees are either. They're just distributed.

&#x200B;

For me, I tried starting a company as a nomad -- but once I got a bit serious about it, I settled down. Traveling just took too much time."
az6xm6,24634n3z,How do I get from Here... to There? Looking for advice to work towards remote living.,"I started a Monday-Friday job a few months ago. I’m an industrial engineer by title and much of what I do in this position is program management. I have a BA in public policy and economics and an MBA. Before that I was in the coast guard where I worked shifts more like a fire fighter or other first responder. This is essentially my first office job. 

At work this week we celebrated someone’s 30 year anniversary with the company with store bought cookies and sliced fruit. That person had never moved out of a 25 mile radius his entire life. It hit me like a tidal wave in my gut that I need to do what’s necessary to not grow old in a corporate office. 

I don’t have a big plan. But I intend to stay in this position for 2-3 years to get the solid chunk on my resume and to learn as much as I can. If it’s helpful I can also get my agile cert, one of the easier project management certs, and six sigma green belt. I could also get another degree for free using a company program available to me once I’ve been here for a year. The internet is mostly trash to get help and advice on transitioning to remote work, hence lurking around here looking for insight. 

Can anyone give me some advice on how to move towards remote work given my current background? I’m comfortable traveling abroad and have done solo trips to South America. I speak some Spanish and am working on becoming fluent. I’m debt free other than paying off my car but will be able to start saving a decent amount of money starting the end of the year.

So about two weeks in Kuala Lumpur now, two more to go!  Here's some first impressions (Excuse my ranting, I might have cabin fever :)

I checked in at my ""Luxury apartment"" at Regalia Suites in Chow Kit. Both the building and my apartment had seen a little more wear and tear than perhaps I expected.  Malaysian climate is not friendly towards buildings. It felt really weird coming from the beach life of Koh Lanta, being surrounded by friends,  to sitting by myself in a ""real apartment"" in a big city where I basically knew no one.

On the flip side that's kinda what I wanted, some time-off to just live healthy (ier) and get some work done without friends, sunset drinks and long islands being a stone throw away. Having a gym and pool in house made it easy to get into a nice routine. Simple things like having a proper TV you could hook up to Netflix was also surprisingly pleasant :)

I started waking up early to do laps at the infinity pool before the Instagram crowd started to arrive. Which kinda worked, but at 7:20 the madness begins. Seeing all the stupid selfie stuff people do, day after day, I quickly lost all hope for humanity.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9g737vc32fl21.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5e7aff722949938bdd047678db83669cd59b0e7

Adding to the isolation was the fact that Regalia is by a motorway and KL isn't exactly walk-able. I have the Sunway Putra mall close by, but getting into Chow Kit proper is quite a walk. Luckily Grab is cheap and easy (although you have to pay cash) and for 10-13 (2 - 3 euro) MYR you'll get almost anywhere. Being lazy I also started Food Panda'ing (like uber food) bunch of cheap Pakistani, Indian, Indonesian and Malaysian food to my place. Which was also super cheap, and delicious. So much rice and Naan though.

I discovered ""Teh Tarik"" which is ""pulled tea"", basically a mix of tea and condensed milk so it's on the sweet side, but delicious. It's like a hot coco comfort drink. Order  ""Kurang Manis"" if you want less sweet.

Kuala Lumpur itself is quite interesting. There's so much greenery everywhere, even along the freeways, which gives it quite a distinct feel. Especially when you combine it with the hi-rises and monorail. On the flip side there are areas that are quite downtrodden so there's a lot of contrast. The population is also a fascinating mix of Malay, Indian, Indonese and Chinese.

&#x200B;

[Light rail](https://preview.redd.it/iw0zigpxxfl21.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54f8f4937b7afa11a3f1c2929ba95e010dd60cbb)

After a while I started venture out and explore KL more. And yeah, in large (except for some neighborhoods) it's not really a city built for pedestrians. There's hardly any crossings and multiple times I found myself awkwardly walking along a free way, or skittering over it like a reindeer in headlights. I went to Pavillion shopping center which has all the western brands and to Berjaya Times square which is a gigantic maze of local clothing stores and nick nacks.

There wasn't anything I particular wanted though (I resisted the temptation to buy a S10) so shopping felt a pointless. I also visited Petaling street market in china town. Counterfeit merch central. Quite an experience but again, wasn't really shopping. I did get to try the street food coffee roasted chestnuts. It was quite a show seeing it prepared although the end product perhaps tastes a little mealy :)

&#x200B;

[Petaling Street Market](https://preview.redd.it/y4aik7kwyfl21.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23945aeac82171dd22b3347a52c908b823226f6b)

I went to cinema, which was super cheap at 9 MYR. My disappointment was great though when the only popcorn you could buy was either ""caramel"" or ""salted egg"". 2 MYR extra for salted egg she said. How much for without the egg I said. No bueno. And it still tasted sweetened :/

I've visited a few of the recommended ""nomad cafe's"" from various guides. VCR, Lokl, Meet Joe (fd Ojo Coffe), Dr.Inc. They were all very nice, but I dunno, there's something that's missing. And you often felt out of place working on your laptop.

I guess  I like a working café's to have a nice atmosphere, not be too fancy, nor too grungy. Be chill and provide good value for money. Also nice if you occasionally run into like minded people that you can strike up a conversation with. Most of these very fancy, and priced accordingly, but also felt a bit soulless. Might as well work from Starbucks.

&#x200B;

[Starbucks Berjaya](https://preview.redd.it/pbv9ufotyfl21.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f300894fc925c7979e9868e699af73bd54aa799)

Maybe a contributing factor is that I've never felt as much an outsider as in KL. Whenever I've traveled to Bali, Thailand etc there's always been Europeans or Americans around. Here you can easily be the only non-Asian wherever you go.  So language and culture is a little bit of a barrier. Then again it's kinda liberating not being surrounded by tourists, it feels refreshingly authentic, if perhaps a bit lonely :)

&#x200B;

[Backyard](https://preview.redd.it/g3se7e6j4fl21.jpg?width=2016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=700f017de62e78a027b4f5caea4cbd96ab50d53a)

I did explore the nightlife briefly, some friends were in town and we went to a pub called Backyard in Sri Hartamas (area that's popular with expats). And man on man did it rock, I don't think I've ever heard such a good live band, and that's saying something. Alcohol is predictably expensive: 20-23 (about 4 euro) MYR for a small pint of peer. A beer costs 7 MYR in the supermarket. While KL is largely Muslim, the people who actually go to pubs, for natural reasons, are not. Had a great time.

&#x200B;

Anyway, my conclusion so far is that I really like KL for what it is. It's like a discount Sydney, a ""real"" big city with Asian prices, but also with western franchises like Nandos, Starbucks, McD etc.  It might not be Chiang Mai cheap but it sure is cheaper than any western city. It also feels a bit more polished than for instance Bangkok.

Maybe it's not a premiere nomad destination, and it can become a bit lonely if you go there yourself,  but It's great if you need to get some shopping and work done without too many distractions, or just need  a change of pace or scenery.  More than a month might be pushing it though.

b0xgmr,3enn89zl,"Digital Nomads out there, what would've made the start of your journey easier?","I'm 6-8ish weeks away from beginning my digital nomad lifestyle. I handed my notice in on Monday to my job and will be leaving around Easter. The next while is all about prepping to leave. I'm a big believer in learning from the wisdom/mistakes of others, so am wondering what those with experience out there already would recommend?

A little about me. British male, early 30's. Fairly well travelled. Selling equity in a house and will have \~$25k liquid. Have a sole client/employer based in Caribbean paying $4k pcm, and will work on side hustles after leaving current job. Considering setting up a UK LTD company (pros/cons anyone?). Have lived the backpacker life before but all hostels and manual labour jobs to raise funds. I'm most drawn to SE Asia after being to Hong Kong, Seoul, and Thailand before and loved them. My SO is leaving her job in summer to join also, and also has similar equity situation.

This isn't a ""how do I become a DM"" post, of which I've read dozens of threads. This is a ""I am going to be a DM, what are the things you wish you did differently?"" post. Prepping beforehand, packing different items, doing different things when arriving, etc. Thanks!"
b0y0ew,3enlicrq,My Goal is to be a FULL TIME Digital Nomad by 2023,"
New to Reddit, thought I could benefit from an actual community of people with similar interests

Backstory: I realized how much I enjoyed traveling and how therapeutic it was from being in the United States Air Force from 2012-2018. I have since seperated and am now working in Doha, Qatar as a contractor for a logistics company. My goal is to quit on or before December 31st 2023 and work remotely full time. 

Questions/Advice:

1. What are your goals/acheivements in relation to being a ""digital nomad""?

2. I'm currently enrolled in The Charted Institute of Marketing Level 4 Course and IATA: Foundation in Travel and Tourism with Amadeus course, because ideally I would like to make my living via freelance marketing within the travel and tourism career field. What are some skills or courses you've taken, plan on taking, or recommend taking and what remote jobs do you think are the best and how do you go about finding them?

3. Are there any tools, resources, YouTube videos, books... etc that have helped you with transitioning into the digital nomad lifestyle? "

Also, it seems, the options for the type of work is the same: Blogging, Vlogging, SEO, Making Websites, other Marketing, Trading, and everything else that requires one to be ""Online"".

b1hpuf,3ezetp8t,I made a mistake. I’m trying to figure out the best way to move forward. (US Health Insurance)," 

I’m a freelancer heading back to the US after 3 months abroad. I can't get individual health insurance. 

My mistake was that I didn’t sign up for a 2019 ACA plan during the enrollment period. 

I thought I would qualify for a Special Enrollment Period. I don't.

I’ve looked into short term health insurance. But I have a pre-existing condition explicitly listed as disqualifying. 

It's very mild and causes me no problems day-to-day. I don’t need medication or require regular doctor visits. And I've had everything checked out -- at a reasonable out-of-pocket cost -- while I've been abroad.

Plus I’m too old for high-deductible plan.

Some options I've been considering:

* Stay out of the US until November when open enrollment starts again, if possible
* Get a part-time job that offers health insurance. But this would take time away from building my freelance business, which is slowly improving - and pays better.
* Take my chances without health insurance in the US

Any ideas would be welcome."
b1n3td,17ikdo,Lima neighborhoods,"I'm headed to Peru for the first time in mid May. I'll probably book an Airbnb for 1 month to start. It seems like Miraflores and Barranco are the two go-to areas?

For anyone familiar with Mexico City, I'd probably prefer the Roma equivalant over Polanco, so I'm guessing that means Barranco? Budget is pretty loose - $500 -$1500 for a month of rent, depending on what I get for it. I'm fairly fluent in Spanish, and don't like super-touristy areas, but I'm under the impression that nowhere in Lima would fit that description.  Sounds like I'll be arriving right as the weather turns gloomy?

b2kmfx,,Advice needed on my online business,"Hey everyone, 

I've lurked here for a while but never posted much. I'd really appreciate some external opinions on this.. 

&#x200B;

I have several online businesses, and I've been self employed working for myself for about 1-2 years now. Income has been at $4500+ a month for at least a year now. 

* I sell Ebooks, and digital products as well as some stuff as an affiliate.
* MOST of my income comes from one website selling my own ebooks and some affiliate stuff. 
* I have several ebooks for sale on my site and kindle, a Udemy course, youtube channel, etc. 
* My niche (I can't give it away but it's fairly small) is shrinking slowly every year in terms of search traffic. I also have a couple of strong competitors rising in the ranks, and in quite a few cases they've outranked my main traffic articles
* I'm still making money and maintaining the income but I feel like its days are numbered, 

So my question is, what should I do next? 

&#x200B;

I've thought about optimising everything as much as I can, so that it's as good as I can get it (it's mostly passive already) and then building a completely new project or putting more of my time into another website..

&#x200B;

But I'm just not sure. 

&#x200B;

I'd ideally like some advice from people who have online businesses making more than $10K a month with a content/information marketing business, and NOT ecommerce or dropshipping related advice because that's not really what I do.

b2r9n4,,Flying across the world... Long layovers or direct?,"Let's say you're flying across the world, such as spain to Thailand, or in my case right now Phoenix to Bali. 

How do you optimize happiness & the adjustment?

Also, this assumes you are not flying first class but instead basic economy because first class would certainly be so much more comfy for method 1...

Method 1 is to hammer it out until you're there, so take one direct flight which is like 13 hours, or have just one couple hour layover, or even multiple layovers but you stay in the airport and get to your destination asap.

Method 2 is to schedule layovers to help you adjust to the jet lag and limit super long flights. 

In the example of Phoenix to Bali that would look like Phoenix to Hawaii, Hawaiian to Japan, Japan to Thailand, Thailand to Bali.

I appreciate any tips and suggestions for my new life and plans! My questions:
- Best bank account/digital bank for a foreigner in US
- Best accomodation option for a digital nomad in Brooklyn (other than an airbnb-like a startup or digital building/space/accelerator with an accomodation? or something similar to Soho House?) 
- Any websites to subscribe to serve companies on a project based as a marketing/digital/bus dev consultant from Europe+Emerging markets.  To get jobs and leads.
- Any communities i can subscribe for networking/meetups in NYC creative and digital communities.

b51lj3,6u9rt,1 month into being a DN,"I realized it's been a month since I started as a Digital Nomad.  I thought I'd make a post about my experience so far, as it could be useful for others and I'm honestly curious how it compares to others' experiences.

For the past 8 years, I've held different full-time jobs as a software developer at both large companies and startups.  I always loved to travel, but never felt confident enough to make the transition to being full-time remote.  About 6 months ago, I had coffee with someone who was looking for a developer for his early-early-stage startup, and when I mentioned I had a passing interest in working remotely he immediately jumped on the idea and said he would support that.  It took a lot of thinking, but eventually I decided it was now or never so I decided to join (I waited a few months until I vested at my previous company though).

I started working for them in mid-February.  I spent a week working on-site, and then another week working from home before I hit the road.  There were definitely some bumps in the process.

The first few weeks were very unproductive for me.  In the first week I was so busy moving out of my apartment that I didn't even find 10 minutes to work.  Week 2 I was in Paris, and I found that trying to work from coffee shops for a couple hours at a time between sight-seeing trips just didn't work.  I became a little stressed out because I wondered how much patience the CEO would have.  I was feeling pretty discouraged and wondered if I should quit, enjoy a few months of travel, then go home and start a new full-time job.

I scheduled a call with him and apologized for my lack of productivity.  We talked for a while and eventually agreed on a new strategy where I would spend 3 days a week just working, and then use the remaining 4 days for travel stuff.  This has actually worked quite well.  I've been in skiing in the Alps, and I need to take a few days off from skiing anyways.  Each work day is becoming more productive than the last.  Today I finished my first major deliverable, and he seemed pretty stoked about it.

Anyways, I'm starting to feel like I can make this work.  Thanks for bearing with my rant :)"

b59dj4,2cgpfn03,Improve my chances of landing a remote job,"I've been working as a local (South Africa) frontend dev for the past 4 years and recently started looking for remote jobs across the world. In my experience the application success rate is vastly different (way more than I expected).   
Locally you would probably send out 5 applications and land 3 interviews, where remotely you'll send out 20 and get 20 rejects, which makes sense cause you have people all over the world applying to these positions.  


My question is what are beneficial things that help you stand out from the rest when applying for a remote position, is it your StackOverflow rep? Your own github repo's/libs , open-source contributions? side-projects?  Which should I focus on first to increase my chances?  


Also what is the expected ratio between applications sent out and and positive feedback for remote jobs?"

b6r5q4,vkgcx,My digital nomad story...,"Hi there fellow ""digital nomads"" and aspiring digital nomads. Depending on how you define things, I've been a digital nomad for 2-8 years now. A lot of the posts on this sub--especially by people who are just getting started--strike me as a little misguided... so I figured hey, why not share my personal story. Maybe it will help someone. 

I left the US in 2010 to become an English Teacher in China. My reasons were that I wanted to see the world and learn Chinese. I had started an IT company in the US and continued to collect passive income as I worked in China. Having a school waiting for me when I got there was a big help because they set me up with an apartment, mandarin classes, and basically everything you need when you land. 

As the years went on and my Chinese ability went up, I transitioned out of teaching and into tech. I worked with a number of software companies in China marketing their products back to Westerners. I discovered that working several part-time jobs was far more profitable than working 1 full time job. Many of these jobs had me traveling around Asia and sometimes even back to the US. 

This went on for about 6 years. During that time I always had 1 employer sponsoring me for a work visa, which allowed me to have a main base in China. Having a ""main base"" was great, because I could develop friendships, get involved in the expat community, and keep all my stuff somewhere. 

2 years ago these part-time jobs I was taking kind of just shifted into freelance work. At a certain point I had to fire my last employer and shift to a tourist visa. I guess this is the point I technically became a digital nomad. 

With the tourist visa came the necessity to travel more often. Some of my favorite spots are Chengdu, Bangkok, and Chiang Mai. Life around Asia is cheap, food is good, the dating scene is pretty fun... Asia feels like home now. 

About a year after I became a digital nomad, I discovered the word ""digital nomad"". I found this subreddit, and read a bit about what others were doing. I tried to check out some ""digital nomad community"" stuff but overall was left disappointed. In my opinion, the ""expat community"" of most places around here is far better. Expats tend to stick around a place for awhile and grow roots. They start businesses, organize fun activities, get to know each-other. 

When I visit home in the US sometimes it seems like all my peers are stuck in a cycle. They work 40 hour weeks to support their mortgages; they take very little time for vacation and travel; they seem strangely obsessed with their material possessions. To them it's normal but to me it's reverse culture-shock. 

When I read here about people wanting to ""get started being a digital nomad"", or that kind of thing... well I get it. People who are stuck in the aforementioned cycle want to escape. I can totally relate to that... I can't imagine moving back home and getting involved in that rat-race again. 

But I guess the thing that always strikes me as odd is that people see ""digital nomad"" as a box they can jump into. Like they're unhappy with their normal-life box so they want to jump into the digital nomad box. The truth is that moving out of your home country and learning to support yourself while abroad is a gigantic possibility-space that can't fit in a box. There are so many ways to do it including places to go, ways to earn a living, and overall lifestyle choices... it's as big as the world itself. 

So anyway, good luck to anyone who is aspiring to leave their normal life and join us out here in the world. And I always enjoy seeings pictures and reading about how others are doing it, especially those laptop-on-the-beach photos that everybody downvotes.

I’m from the US but I graduated from a university in china with a BA in Chinese language. I’ve worked in a few office jobs since coming back home from china but spending 40 hours every week in a cubicle just feels soul crushing.

I’m moving back to Asia in a few months to live with my gf and find work there, but since realizing the digital nomad lifestyle is a possibility, I can’t stop imagining how nice it would be to have a job that would allow me to travel, not be in a cubicle for 40 hrs a week, and would allow me to work on my own time and under my own supervision.

I can’t code, but would be willing to learn if coding is the best way to get into this lifestyle. I can speak fluent mandarin however, but I realize translation jobs are usually done from your second language into your first language (Mandarin to English in my case), and I’m not sure the demand from Mandarin to English translation is there. I also don’t have experience translating professionally, and I’m not sure where to start.

I’m locked into a contract office job until May, but planning to move to Asia in June/July. My question is: where do I start? I’ll have some free time before the move to do whatever will help.

I’m thinking I could do translation for a while while I learn coding in my free time. Is it feasible to become a sort of full time digital nomad by the time the move comes around in a few months? Especially seeing as I have little experience in translation and none in coding? Any opinions on my situation in general?

Thanks in advance!

b84c02,38kqyj7x,EU/Schengen Area with UK passport - stay length,"My wife and I are looking to finally move over to a proper digital nomad lifestyle. We have been preparing for something similar to this for a while, before we even knew the term digital nomad. Our goal at the time was for us to travel to where contract/jobs were good for me (devops/linux engineer) and my wife would start writing as this has always been something she wanted to try. Before we do start to put the final wheels in motion over the 3-6 few months I would love to get a bit of a sanity check on what we are doing and if we are missing something completely obvious.

As a we bit of context we managed to sell our house about 4 years ago, it was a terrible place, cost a fortune, in a bad area and various other reasons. Unfortunately a health issue came up just after this which put a halt to our plans for a few years but it turned out for the better in the long run as I was able to secure a good/better remote working job and the health issue has since been fixed. Hence the reason traveling with a digital nomad lifestyle would suit us really well. 

**The Rough Plan**

Ignoring Brexit for now, as this may all change. 

We are planning on trying out various places within the EU (Schengen Area) first of all, aiming to stay at each location for roughly 3-6+ months depending on how we much we like the place. Looking at spending most of the time doing long sublets at Airbnb’s or if the chance comes up, house sitting. I was going to just continue getting paid taxed etc in the UK and changing our home address to one of our parents houses or a traveling mailbox for our banks etc

Now this is the bit am not really sure about and getting really conflicting information about when I read up on it. Most posts/blogs and books I have read normally cover people outwith the EU staying, working within Schengen Area or self employed. As both being UK passport holders, can we stay in an EU/Schengen Area country (Spain is first on our list) for 3+ months without having to register as a resident?

The reason I would want to avoid registering as a resident as I think (please correct me if I'm wrong) this may start to get a bit complicated with staying in Airbnb's and mainly my work - if I then have to start declaring income, taxes or any other paperwork in Spain only to leave Spain 2 months later then have to do it all again in another country such as Germany.

Things I have read so far suggest that because our UK passports are not stamped within the EU/Schengen Area you can just stay with zero issues. On the flip side of this I have also read that your passport is recorded when you book into a Airbnb or hotel with the local police (happens when we have be on shorter stays/holidays) so they do know how long you have been there for.

In a nutshell I would like it to be as simple as: 

* Move to an EU/Schengen Area country (Spain)
* Stay 3-6+ months
* Move to another EU/Schengen Area country and repeat
* Meanwhile still working remotely for a UK company and paying UK taxes etc

But I fear it may not be as simple as this. If it means we can only stay within the Schengen Area for 90 days out of 180 days on a UK passports then we can adjust our plans of stay lengths and where to visit.

**Other Details**

Not sure if these would be relevant or not to registering as residents or other types of visa's : 

* Bottom-line monthly income of £2700, taxed and paid into a UK bank account.
* Have a remote job with a UK company, sometimes requires an office visit once a month for a day.
* Zero debt(credit cards, loans etc) or contracts(phones etc)
* £27000 in savings
* Currently rent housing
* We are both mid/late 30s
* We already live a minimal lifestyle, outwith a few bits of Ikea furniture our life belongings can fit into 2-3 suitcases - could easily be less.
* Outwith the EU I wasn't going to bother saying that I am working, I don't think there is any point. No one will really know that I am working remotely so would just get tourist/holiday visa as normal outwith the EU and leave when that is up.

Any links or advice would be awesome!

Which I did for 4+ month or so in central america. I enjoyed every second of it, from hikes and parties with travelers to off the beaten track stuff such as looking for gold in some random jungle and with random locals at the Nicaragua border.

Now Im back to sad Europe and feeling shit at this idea. I told myself that Id become a freelancer to be able to travel and earn money at the same time.. however it seems much harder than i thought as a c++ guy to find a proper task, other languages seem to have much more opportunities. That and the fact that the french gov is a b\*\*\* regarding taxes for entrepreneurs.

Then I thought that even if I found tasks - would that be enough to improve my c++ as a 4yo dev ? Would that be enough to build a good cv? and more importantly, how much time would i need to spend hunting for a c++ task that is already hard to find and rewarding.

Remote jobs seemed to be a good option... but you still need to show up at the office once in a while, and if i work for an european company from south america, it could be a tad hard, plus the fact that you need to work with office hours..

In the end Im thinkin that the best option is to find another office job that pays well and that is interesting and leave for another trip at some point... But Im feeling like its going to affect my cv if I have too many gaps.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**tldr**: If i want to travel long term again in the future: Should I be persistent and carry on in the freelance direction, knowing that as a c++ dev, it might give a tad difficult or should i find another office job, and leave in a year or 6 month, which would create more gaps in my cv and potentially affect future interviews"

Fukuoka is branding itself the ""[Startup City of Japan](https://startup.fukuoka.jp/startup-package)"", and I intend to check if that's really the case. Unlike the rest of Japan, its population is [growing](https://www.fukuoka-reit.jp/eng/beginner/potential/ingather/).

* I am a nomad like you, not a travel agent. No intention to ask money to any participants. I do this so I can make sure to have a great time meeting like-minded people while there, considering that there are not many English speakers in this city! :-)

&#x200B;

The idea is to gather a group 10-15 nomads from here and other platforms, so that we live and experience the city together. I'll organize us a coworking space, and will do research work to provide lists of accommodation. I'll also organize activities for the group.

&#x200B;

[Here are some group outing ideas I could be organizing.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oOOhQgmRVAV4ZOkbQxEGfKnIoO_BCCXuqFn6mmfeUUc/edit?usp=sharing) All ideas are welcomed.

Right now we use Asana for tasks, and Slack and Skype to chat. 

I was wondering if anyone had additional advice for staying on top of communicating while I'm in a 12-hour time zone difference? 

We're basically building a new website together (I do more overall management and the front end and one of the other devs is doing back end on it) and I want to make sure I'm being effective at staying in touch and making the same progress I would be back home to make a good impression on me while working remotely."

Basically, i put a lot of lotion on my skin and just scorch the itchy area with hot air. Don't hurt yourself or anything, just get it hot enough that its on the edge of being too hot.  Rinse off the lotion and your skin will be itch free.

I don't claim to understand this,  but i read that the heat accelerates the breakdown of the saliva left in the bite from the bug.  Its the saliva that makes your skin freak out, it has some kind of bad protein in it that most people are allergic too."

baw9h9,9p7vd,I need your help creating a fair compensation plan for a local small business,"Hey, I get the opportunity to help a local small business expand their sales. I'm trying to set up a fair performance based system which I've never done before. I know these seem high but because they're coming out of profit it means any business expenses get taken out before I get paid. What do ya'll think of:

1. 30% of **profits** from tracking codes. For example, we have fliers with a code that people use at checkout and I receive 30% of profits, after you count for cost of the product.
2. 30% of **profits** from direct sales. For example, an email I write secures a catering event, I receive 30% of the profits from that contract. (Even if it lasts a year and is reoccurring).
3. 30% of **additional profit** I bring in compared to last year's average. How this works would be that we compare your last year's average revenue to this year's before I begin working for you. Then, we see the impact I have on profits after I begin working with you all. So if you're doing 20% better this year than last year, then I begin working with you and by the end of the summer you're doing 40% better, then I would receive 30% of that extra 20%. So if I bring in an extra $10000, I'd get $2000.  

For reference I make 83,000 a year which translates to arguably a $65 an hour freelance rate (gets pumped up because lack of salary benefits) So I'm trying to find a way to ensure I can make my fair compensation without them having to pay if I don't perform."
baznff,niq9i,Managing 8-5 work hours remotely,"Hey Nomads,

I’ve been working remotely in customer service since the start of the year and it’s going really great!

I had my first performance review last week and got glowing feedback and a pay rise, after already getting a 25% pay increase and being allowed to work entirely remotely after trying to quit my job to relocate last year. 

My question is - those of you that are required to keep normal office hours, how do you balance this and your out of work life, to get the most out of your remote work? I’m required to be available to take calls for 9 hours a day and it does interfere with any day-time plans and makes it hard to travel with my SO, as she will be sitting around all day while I’m working with only the evenings free. 

I’m only travelling in my own country due to time zones, but would love to go further afield and tips on working to office hours in another timezone are welcome.

Any tips or thoughts much appreciated.

I will be having a remote job (contractor) with a company in country Y (also in EU)

I would be going to Australia on a WHV (WHV because I want to stay longer than the tourist visa duration).

&#x200B;

=> Am I capable of retracting my tax residence of country X. Based on the fact that I will be spending the coming year in Australia + haven't worked in country X in last year and a half.

=> I am to consider Australia as my tax residence country and report my income made from my contract with company in countr Y ? I'm unsure about this because of the WHV, on the website of the WHV it says that I can't be considered an Australian resident (unless you show ""intent"" to build a life in Australia) and would be a ""foreign resident"" for tax purposes instead.  


edit: in some way I am exploring the possibility of the ""perpetual traveler"" thing and on the other hand I am just trying to figure out how a WHV and a remote job in an EU country interact / need to be handled."

I would love to be in the ‘bangkok’ of Latin America if that exists and am very much a mountains over beach person. I’d like to keep up my Muay Thai / boxing (I’m sure I could find spots to do this in each city).

Love places like Bangkok, Bogota, Havana, Berlin. Not really a fan of places like Chiang Mai, San Francisco, Barcelona, Bali. 

Of course I can always scope them both out and see where I like but I also need to tell my employer where I’m likely to reside for half the year.

bbs7b2,2u70cb6q,My Journey from ZERO to 285k Page Views a Month After Only 4 Months,"I am hoping this post will motivate someone to take action and go for their dreams because posts like these always motivated me.

First of all, I have been trying for 12 years to start a successful online business and lost tens of thousands of dollars in the process. It has not been an easy process at all.

I decided to go a different route from bloggers and start a niche news website because for those of us who are not creative writers, news articles are a lot easier because you simply just have to rewrite and add some extra unique info.

I'm just over 4 months in and my site has 285k views over the past 30 days. Out of that, only 33k is from organic search, so although I'm starting to rank a little bit in search engines, I'm not yet getting the same kind of organic traffic my competitors are (about 1 million organic per month).

My traffic has come almost entirely from people sharing my content, but one thing that really helped was getting approved for Google News within about 2 weeks of launching the site because it brought in a bit of traffic and (I believe) helped other news sites find me so I was able to start building powerful backlinks from sites like the Guardian and Forbes after just a few weeks.

The site now has over 10,000 backlinks, according to Ahrefs, and they are all naturally built. 

As far as income, I'm in the final stage of the approval process with Mediavine right now but until I get approved with them (hopefully), I am stuck with low-paying Adsense and only on track to bring in about $900 in ad revenue this month.

I have a long list of ways I plan to monetize once I build a significant following but for now, my following is growing a lot slower than traffic (only about 3k total followers on combined social media pages).

My affiliate pages are not yet ranking either so that will be another way to monetize once I start to rank.

News sites are a lot more work because you have to post several articles every single day to remain relevant, instead a few articles a week like a blog. However, they are also a lot more rewarding as your traffic potential is huge. Not very many blogs get a million view per month but news sites easily hit that, even small town, local ones I found.

Also, contrary to what I read about how you can't monetize a news site because people reading news don't want to pay, that is not true for niche news. The people who are so passionate about any specific topic that they want daily updates on it are more open to spending on products you promote.

For example, I recently discovered a beauty pageant news site. They are selling stuff to parents who put their kids in pageants in addition to beauty courses and products for adults. I'm sure they are making serious bank. That's not to mention the potential for starting a subscription magazine as well, YouTube income, etc.

Any niche you can think of, there is likely an audience passionate enough that they want news. I've found cruise industry news sites, agriculture news sites, you name it, it probably can be done.

This post is getting way too long so if you have any questions, feel free to ask."

bdtzzt,valxq,Starting tips recently graduated (Embedded) Software Engineer,"**TLDR;**  **How to start a digital nomad life as an (Embedded) Software Engineer straight out of University?**

&#x200B;

At the end of 2018, I successfully graduated as an (Embedded) Software Engineer. I moved from the Netherlands to live with my girlfriend in Romania. Unfortunately, I've been struggling to find a job that matches my interests and skills so far. I have always had a love for travelling and want to start roaming as soon as possible. That's how I came across this subreddit.

I have looked through many links and done loads of google searches for different job openings. However, most of the developer positions seem to be either aimed at web development and/or require a significant amount of experience (3-5 years minimum). Are there any of you who started their digital nomad life as a developer straight out of University? If so, do you have any tips to share? I'm highly motivated and love my area of work. Therefore, I would prefer to stay in this area and not switch to web development. I have considered that starting my own company would be an option. However, starting a company while travelling and building a client list seems to be a rather dangerous and difficult task.

Any advice, experience or input, in general, is very much appreciated!"

Both are relatively small so these activities are a big part of the vibe and are often the primary reason nomads come to them. I'm sure you can find scuba divers in a lot of major coastal cities, but it's just one activity of many and requires getting out of the city proper to do it.

I'm currently in Chiang Mai staying in the Old City, and, while I feel like it's pretty nice, I haven't noticed much special here at all. We got here a week ago, so we enjoyed Sangkran, which was really cool, but, side from that, I'm wondering what all of the hype about this city is supposed to be about. I know that the general ""digital nomad area"" is supposed to be Nimman, but we went there, and while there were some restaurants, coffee shops, and a few coworking spaces, it didn't seem like a nice area to walk around in or like there was all that much there. Overall, the Old City seems like a nicer area.

Overall, Chiang Mai seems like such a heavily hyped place that I feel like I must have just missed something. In Nimmad, we mostly just walked down the main road and looked down some of the side streets and didn't see much. I don't want to write the place off, but after having been a nomad for about a year now, I'm just not quite getting why it's such a popular destination. Have I just not gone to the right places yet?

beopie,1ezgim1p,"I'm at a career crossroads. Nomadic life is the goal, but I'm not sure what would get me there best","This is going to be long, I'll try to condense. 

Ultimately, I want to be able to travel and work from anywhere. Nomad. Y'all get it. 

With my personal skill set (some light programming experience, and 5 years of QA experience) I thought my best bet would be to learn web design, and grab low level clients at first (Wordpress websites) and move on to full stack web development. Always seems to be jobs for that and I think I'd enjoy that. 

Problem is that's a HUGE field to cover and a LOT of learning I'd have to find time to do. And most likely I'd have to work as an entry level at a proper company for a while before I got enough experience/skills to truly go freelance. So, that'd put me back at least a year or two. 

My other pathway is a traveling field technician. My neighbor goes on data migration gigs all over the world, working for sometimes 7-10 days straight setting up Apple stores and the like, making a ton of money, then taking the next however long he wants off. I would use this time off to travel and to write. 

My problem here is I've been using Fieldnation and Workmarket, and it's been a lot or hit or miss. I'm slowly building a name, but the pay is low, and I don't see a good opportunity to learn more vital skills that would bump me up to his pay bracket. 

Unless... I go with the job I was just offered. It's a company that works through Dell, and I'd be driving to peoples houses and replacing their laptop HDs and motherboards. Low pay grunt work, but I'm promised it's a pathway to more enterprise level projects. Data centers. Migrations. Eventually. I could then take that knowledge on the road. 

But that means working a 9-5 for a year while I build up the contacts and learn some more technical skills. 

Seems the 9-5 is inescapable in the short run. 

My final option, and the one that would be easiest for me currently. I have 5 years experience has a QA tester. I have one or two classes ready to be bought to hone my QA automation skills to bump me into QA Engineering. The money there is consistent and good and there's tons of offerings. 

But I have ZERO idea how well QA automation translates to the nomadic lifestyle. Everything seems to point straight towards office work, forever. 

Can anyone give me any advice at all? Should I just take the Dell job? Or should I focus on studying QA automation, considering I've already worked in QA for 5 years?

TLDR: Should I be an IT cable runner, a QA engineer, or take the long long path to web development, if I want to work from anywhere?"

beys0j,3m8ohort,Lessons learned from my journey into location independent work,"As a new user to reddit and this sub, I thought it would be a good idea to give something back after lurking for a while. I am not identifying myself 100% as a digital nomad, but the term “digital nomad” is what sparked my interest, and started it all. My journey might be a bit different than the ones I read here before. Until recently, i never worked for a big company in a 9 to 5 job, so there was no escape needed.

This will be a collection of my “lessons learned”, in no particular order. I hope it might help some people who are thinking about starting the same journey. For me, it has been, first and foremost, a learning experience. Things which i thought would pose a major problem, were no problem at all. Other things, mostly concerning personal stuff, turned out to be a an issue where I never thought they would.

Myself: 35y, German, IT guy since age 15, owning small IT company the last 14 years, mostly small customers, on site support, the basics. Introvert with a few good friends, no affinity to social media. No coding skills besides some PowerShell commands and the odd PHP here and there.

With this background, I discovered the term “digital nomad” about 4 years ago. This sparked my interest: Traveling, working remote, no office, my own quiet place wherever I want it to be? I started to googling around, and found the 4-Hour Workweek pdf on some shady, russian server. I did not like it. Yes, the idea was valid, and no doubt, it worked for him. But the tone of “everybody who is not following their dreams and quit their job is doing it wrong” was not appealing to me. Having low income slaves helping me produce online stuff that nobody really needs was not my type of thing.

But the idea stuck, and I started to make a plan how to transition my work into something that can be “location independent”. Already working in IT, this seemed possible. After looking left and right about what others were suggesting (passive income, drop shipping, blogging, guides etc.), I quickly realized that this is not something I want to do. It might have worked, but it was just not my thing.

So I planned transitioning my current job, owner of a small IT shop, to allow location independence. As I was the owner, there was nothing stopping me, as I could basically do what I see fit, without asking someone. In the real world, it was a little bit more complicated. Even being the owner, I still was involved in a lot of hands on stuff. So while the typical german company owner seems to be busy counting money and deciding about which BMW to buy next, a was 100% involved in all the hands on stuff. Money was OK but not great, but starting to get better. Risking a customer base build over 15 years was nothing that I wanted to do.

I made a plan to have a “test run” for 2-3 month in Thailand. KohHub on Koh Lanta was what I selected. It worked out well, and I expanded it more and more, also switching to project work, away from my existing customers. I came to the realisation: Yes, it is possible, and No, it is not all positive.

The next and hardest step was to get a foothold in the corporate world. This was something completely new for me. And I was basically doing it the wrong way around: The “normal” career seems to be to start in a corporation, work up the corporate ladder, then after 20 years you can stand the bullshit anymore, and open your own little shop or freelance. For me it was the other way around.

I was completely surprised by what I experienced, expecting to meet a bunch of highly professional people, every one of them someone to look up to, to learn from. The opposite was true. I never knew that people could earn so much money for basically doing nothing productive all day. I could go on and on about that, but in the end, my fear that my skills where inadequate to play with the “big guys” was misguided.  As my goal was still to get more and more location independent, it was a welcome surprise that nobody cared from where you work.

So right now, I would say that I am 85% digital nomad.  :-)   I still have a base in Germany, and I have to travel to customer sites once in a while. Besides that, location doesn’t matter.

Here are some lessons learned on the way. For most of them, I which someone had told me at the beginning. This is especially true if you doubt yourself a lot, and always think: “Can I do it?”. In most cases, the answer was YES, but it takes time to realize that.


Disclaimer: These are **my** thoughts, and you might disagree. That is fine. I am sharing my experiences, hoping that it might be of help to someone.



**Some of your friendships will change**

And this is a nice way to say it. Nobody is waiting for you at the airport to ask you about your trip. People go on with their lives. The first weeks, there might be some curiosity, but that will fade. The friends you stay in contact are the ones that you can count on.

You have to make an effort to see them once in a while. And with effort, I mean: I have to go to their place, not the other way around. Just because travelling is my thing, does not mean they feel the same. For most of me friends, the once in a year holiday is still the only travel they do. Asking them to “come over to $nice_sea_location for a week” won’t work.

The first reflex is to say: “OK, then these are the wrong friends.” But this is not true. There decision to have a 9-5 job, a family, a house, doesn’t change the friendship. And when shit will ever hit the fan, these are the ones I can trust. So i have to get my ass moving once in a while.


**Networking works different than expected**

As an introvert, thinking about being in a room full of unknown people to exchange business cards and “keep in touch” gives me the shivers. In the beginning, I thought this is something I have to endure. I attended some conferences, some business owner meetings, some networking events. I hated it. It is just not my thing. And I think if you don’t feel like home there, and sparkle of awesomeness, nothing good will come out of it.

Working on my own, with my own base of small customers, I never had much opportunity to network. This changed when I started freelancing for a bigger cooperation. Suddenly, you are surrounded by hundreds of people from different backgrounds, contractors, sub contractors, different branches, etc. All of them had a past company they worked for, and will have a future company they work for.

This opened up a multitude of opportunities. Just be doing good work, you will build your network. No awkward “networking events” required. This was, and still is, the major upside of working for a bigger corporation.


**Technical issues are solvable**

When I started the test run on Koh Lanta, I was worried about my setup. I need reliable phone connections, and must be able to use certain VPNs at the same time. Losing connection in a critical moment, or having bad voice quality, was unacceptable for me.

It turned out that my own perfectionism wasn’t shared by my customers. As long as they know that I am still reachable, nobody cared about a dropped call or a spotty TeamViewer session.

There has been much improvement in the last years, and remote audio, online conferencing, Skype 4 Business etc, they just work. While hip web teams have already transitioned away from normal phone calls, call in conferences are still the norm in “not so hip” companies. But this is now daily business, and someone joining a conference call from the other side of the world has become normal.

 
**Sometimes this distance IS a problem**

While I can access a server the same way from Tokyo and from Munich (by starting the VPN and Putty), there are situations where being not in the same room with the team will put you in a disadvantage. 

In my small shop, this is mostly during stuff involving personal things. Not being there for the birthday sit in, not being there when someone had a car crash, not being there when they have a baby…

Yes, they know I will be reachable in seconds, we can have a video call. But in the end, it is not they same. I am not there, and I will not know what is spoken when the Skype call ended. There is some sense of disconnect, especially when you worked with your team for a long time, and have a very close relationship.

In the corporate environment, you need someone to relay all the gossip to you. Because a lot of informal talk will happen near the coffee machine, which you will miss. With everybody trying to improve their own, you might be left behind when a decision is due. Right now, doing good work seems to keep my boat floating, even without chit chat, so I don’t care so much.


**Coworking spaces are overrated**

While I am glad that I started my journey at KohHub (which I can highly recommend), I found that coworking spaces are not for me. My work does not improve having people in the same room doing stuff, or in most cases, talking about stuff they think they want to work on.

For me, for a coworking space to really shine above a glorified coffee shop, it would need:

* Excellent, redundant internet. And I don’t mean different SSIDs with “The workplace 1”, “The workplace backup”, etc. I mean an own AS, routed for load balancing, high quality low latency connections, with the possibility to get static IPv4/IPv6 addresses. UPS backup, redundant network, QoS for VoiP and so on. I can make a WiFi hotspot myself, and every Starbucks has some kind of internet. When a place is build for remote workers, I would expect the best.
* High quality office chairs. I do not want to sit on a shitty chair. I do not want to come early to get “the good chair”.
* Height adjustable standing desks. This is a must when working long hours at a laptop. SKARSTA from IKEA will do, no motor needed.
* Open 24h, with the same level of service. Sometimes it can’t be helped, time zone difference, and work needs to be done. It is that moment, at 3am, when I need that sandwich, because everything else is closed, and I can’t leave my desk.
* Quiet working environment when I need it.
* Rental keyboard, video, mouse, all power adapters on site.

When I look at KohHub and some other spaces, I can see that things are moving in that direction, so I am not the only one wishing for these kind of things.


**Nice homes are underrated**

Especially in south east asia, there seems to be a popular form of housing: The studio.

I did not know the meaning of the word, as in Germany, these places are called “one room place” or “Studentenbude (cheap place for students)”. Studio sounds more upscale.  :-)

While I lived in a few nice Studios, I was clearly lying to myself about that being “the good life”. I like to work from my own room, as I really need to concentrate sometimes. I now save the money for coworking spaces. I get a nicer apartment from the beginning, and do daily trips to coffee shops if I feel like it.

For me, this made a **huge** difference. Having at least two rooms makes it possible to get some kind of routine, and separate work and private time. I know there are people who like to live in that 5$/day beach hut with a single light bulb on Koh Chang. That’s fine, but it is not for me.


**Separation of work and private time gets harder**

When I first read about the nomad lifestyle, I thought that some brief moments of work (on the beach, of course) will go hand in hand with party and cocktail drinking. Basically a holiday with checking eMails now and then. I already knew that this might not be the case, but 4 years ago, that was the image presented by dozens of articles and blogs.

While this might be the case for some, I suppose for the most people it will be: Work. Work, just at a different place. And while everybody at home thinks you are living the good live, I discovered that it is **really** **easy** to work more and more and more. There are no appointments, no closing of the office, no friends waiting outside to pick you up for the cinema.

I found myself working 16 hours without really noticing it, only leaving the apartment to get some dinner. This is not the way to go, and I am no forcing myself to separate work and private time, work out, go swimming, meet new people. After all, this is why I choose to be at a nice place to work.


**There is no “community” in the way you might thought**

You will not arrive in a coworking space, making new friends and find new business partners on the first day. If you, like me, need time to connect with people, it might take much longer. There **are** opportunities, and you will meet interesting people. But in the beginning, **you are on your own**.

I also met a number of totally clueless people who thought that just arriving at a nice island with some vague idea will kickstart the nomad life in no time. Well, it did not. What was most astounding to me: I still had facebook, and the image they were projecting home was totally different from what was actually happened. This might attract more people who think “everything will be easy once I arrive in $tropical_island.

Where the community **can** help you from the beginning, is navigating the local issues, like VISA requirements, help with your mobile SIM card, vehicle renting etc. But if you are prepared, and did some due diligence, you will already know a lot of these things.


**Final thoughts**

So, would i do it again? YES, absolutely. And if you are thinking about making the first steps, then do it. It might be for you, it might not be. But you have to try to know.

What would i have done different? Approach project work in a big corporation earlier. This opened a lot of doors really fast, and i should have done it earlier.

In the end, becoming a “85% nomad” was the right choice, and a great learning experience. Do not be fooled by the few people that claim to just kick start their passive income business from one day to the other. It takes time and effort to steer in the right direction. If someone happen to get lucky with trading or bitcoins, fine. But i think for most of us, who would like to transition to remote work, this involves hard work."

bf0yid,174zef,Why I prefer not to hire digital nomads,"I've spent many thousands of dollars with contractors over the last couple of years, with some of those contractors being digital nomads. I actually aspire to be a digital nomad myself (in a sense), so I'm not shitting on DNs. 

But I've had some bad experiences with them, and I think that some of this can be attributed to the type of person attracted to the DN lifestyle. 

Personally, for me, a good guideline is to generally avoid DNs unless there is a compelling reason to work with them. A few reasons:

**Communication.** I'm in US Central timezone, so when I'm working with a DN in Asia, someone either has to stay late or start early. I've also had a number of Skype calls where the call is fuzzy or keeps dropping. Further, I've had times when people struggled either in calls or in deadlines due to poor internet. Maybe it's good one week and bad the next.

**Lack of Dedication.** In my experience, digital nomads are often more interested in their own lifestyle and travel experiences than in producing excellent work products. That's OK - quality of life and new experiences are very important to me too, and people are allowed to prioritize their life how they want. It's just my preference to work with people who are more dedicated to work.

A lot of DNs are into a certain lifestyle involving having lots of girlfriends, drinking, living in ""paradise,"" etc. I have no problem with this. It's just that, in my experience, they're often not the best choice for me.

**Distraction.** DNs are often losing a lot of time due to travel and shifting locations - they're in Bali one week and Chiang Mai the next. They're constantly changing AirBNBs. This lack of stability often seems to make rushed work products. 

**Conclusion.** ""NOT ALL NOMADS!"" Yes, not all DNs are like I've described. Some are going to be amazingly talented and dedicated. But all things being equal, if I have to make a choice, I'm going to opt for the person who lives a more routine existence, because that consistency is often reflected in their work."

I'll probably do this for other cities in Mexico, especially since it's low season.

NOTE: If you go to negotiate, reach out to only places that you'd actually be willing to rent (given everything goes well), and do it 1-3 at a time. Spamming hosts will get you kicked off Airbnb."

Why are so many reviews inaccurate and dishonest?

EDIT: I don't know if it's revelant or not, but I'm only basing this off experiences in Europe. US Airbnbs, from my experience, have been way more accurate and nicer. Europeans seem to have much lower standards when it comes to being a host. But of course it depends on the city too!

bgnlxr,3czpown3,The highs and lows of short-term rentals,"The DN lifestyle is not for the faint of heart or those without patience. The isolation, the lack of enforced routine, the distance from friends and family, it adds up -- but we all know this well in advance of setting sail, so we don't complain about it. This is what we signed up for.

One thing that might not be so obvious to would-be DNs is that short-term rentals can be a complete pain in the ass. This is meant to be a selling point of the lifestyle: stay in nice places you couldn't usually afford in your own country, because they are cheaper in SEA or SA or EE. For just US $500/month you can live in a serviced apartment with a view!

But there is another side to this story. Short-term rentals can turn out to be one disaster after another. Again, patience is a virtue, and you might need a lot of it.

Active DNs on this sub, what have been your experiences with short-term rentals? What have been the highs, what have been the lows? And were you prepared for just how bad some places turned out to be? If the problems didn't become apparent until *after* you signed your lease, did you stick out the term, or cut your losses and run?

As for me, I've stayed in two high-end (four star, although one claimed to be five star -- lol) apartment complexes in Kuala Lumpur, and both have turned out to be much worse than I had expected. Noisy neighbours who can be heard through thin doors in bizarrely-designed rooms. Air-conditioning units breaking with no technicians available for three days. The water being turned off for three days, so the infinity pool being unavailable for, you guessed it, three days. 

Again, these are high-end places, not bottom-of-the-barrel wastelands. And this is in KL, which is fairly well-developed by SEA standards. I can only imagine what people deal with in lower-cost rentals and/or less-developed countries.

Have I just been unlucky, or is this a secret underbelly of the DN lifestyle which few people dare speak of?"

bgtnuq,3hijsgsr,"After many good years, my nomad life might have to end I'm not sure what to do","Hey everyone,

&#x200B;

I would really love to hear your advice. I've been a digital nomad for almost six years. I never really worked in a company because I literally started freelancing just before I graduated from university (so the only companies I ever worked in were during my degrees). Basically all these years I had two sources of income: Ebooks (Kindle) and Content locking. It went so incredibly well for me from the beginning that I never really bothered to dive into any other fields, which I now kinda regret. I did manage to save a lot of money and live the life I always dreamed of- Until now.

&#x200B;

So basically both of those income streams have ended. Yes, I'm still getting some passive income from both, not much though. They didn't end because I stopped working, but because of many reasons (e.g. more competition, change of algorithm, change of rules/commissions etc). For the past year and a half, I've mainly lived off my savings. I still have enough savings to live the life I'm living for another 3-4 years. Then I burned everything. So now I don't know what to do. I don't wanna sound like a spoiled brat, but the thought of me working in an office 9 hours a day depresses me so much. I don't mind working hard, I don't mind working at nights or weekends, but in the corporate world? I don't know if I can, and I'm pretty sure I don't want that. 

&#x200B;

But then, what are my alternatives? I know what my skills are: I'm a good writer (articles/stories/SEO/copywriting), I'm good at organizing things, I'm creative, I have some skills in setting up websites (not a programmer, but i've made websites before with Hosting, basic Html and Wordpress)  and basic skills in IG and FB ads. 

&#x200B;

I don't really expect you guys to tell me what I could do with my skills, I'd just like to hear your opinion on what you would do if you were in my shoes. Go back to corporate life? Try staying a nomad, in the same niche, different niche? Maybe someone has made a similar experience (failing with their business after years of success) and managed to built up new income streams? Just looking for advice, inspiration, motivation, whatever it is.

bh016r,ufnrr,Why Most Of You Don't Deserve Digital Nomad Lifestyle,"**Why Most Of You Don't Deserve Digital Nomad Lifestyle**


Yes, I said it. Now when I got your eyeballs let me explain.


For a long time I wanted to get this off my chest, now it is the perfect time for me to actually write about it.


The reason most people here do not deserve to have a Digital Nomad lifestyle is because most people here are simply not ready.


I have read/heard so many life stories, where guys jump right into DN lifestyle, probably just to feel better about themselves for a short period of time and eventually failing. In most occasions, something happened to their source of income.


While there is nothing wrong with taking a plunge deep into the sea and risking the biscuit, let me continue.

From my experience, many individuals start Digital Nomad lifestyle with:


1. No stability in their remote job or business.
2. No or minuscule savings.
3. Nothing under their name, for example, having your own apartment is basically a safe-spot where you can go if shit goes south.
4. No backup plan, same as the first point basically.


I have heard many stories where so called ""failed digital nomads"" stopped their lifestyle and moved back to their country and took 9-5 job.

Unfortunately, we don't hear a lot of these stories, many individuals only share their successes, but let us not ignore the other side of the coin. edit: **For every success story there are tons of failure stories.**


Few questions to ask yourself:

- We all want to live the best lifestyle we imagined, but do YOU actually deserve it? Are you **objectively** at the point (or very close) where it is possible?

- Have you **hustled** enough to be worthy of such **luxury**?

- Do you want to start DN lifestyle with zero stability, what if you fail? (You know pretty well that the percentage of failure is pretty high, unless you work like crazy.)


**Why I am making this post?**


While I do love seeing people posting their pictures in this particular group, **we never know the full story**. Unfortunately, people lie and we never know the bigger picture. 

For many naive guys in their super early 20s, Digital Nomad lifestyle is like a shining ray of hope. Nothing wrong with having a dream, sadly, *reality is often disappointing!*


**Why did I finally decided to write this post** ? 


Because after 5 years of grinding, sacrificing things I love, destroying bridges with people I cared about, I am finally at the point where I can **objectively** start Digital nomad lifestyle without destroying myself mentally and emotionally. 

Remember 4 points I mentioned at the start of the post? 

In my honest opinion, these conditions need to be met before starting DN lifestyle with no stress. 

Why have short term success to satisfy your ego, when you can be patient and have DN lifestyle for a long period of time.

Little disclaimer: I do agree many people should take risks and push themselves over their limits, but the world is not simple and sometimes things happen without YOUR EFFORT being the deciding factor.


My fellow hustlers and underdogs, I wish you strength to endure everything.

The air quality sucks, general food quality sucks (even for above average venues). 

Nightlife is very expensive due to high alcohol prices. People smoke inside all the time. 

There is virtually no tourist attractions in the city, beside old Dutch town.

There is a lot of poor/rich division, like there are modern skyscrapers and nearby slum-like areas.  

There are a lot of loud prayers from mosques few times per day, starting very early in the morning. 

There are huge traffic jams and commuting usually is a challenge in itself.

bi6rk6,4brk1,Base City in Italy,"I am a late twenties American male that will be visiting and working out of Italy for 8-9 weeks from mid July to mid September. 

I’m looking for suggestions for a “base city” where I will live for most of that time. I plan on taking a week or so upon arrival (flying into Milan) to travel about (welcome for suggestions on that time as as well) but otherwise looking to stay rooted in the same city minus 3-4 day weekend trips. 

Criteria:

* Decent internet (required for job)

* Walkable city/city center

* Nightlife/dating scene (recently single so not looking for a “quiet” village etc)

* Culinary destinations (I assume this is most cities)

* Somewhat of an Expat/Backpacker community (I am learning Italian and the point of working here is language immersion, but nice to speak English every now and then)

I know Italy isn’t super popular for DN as it’s expensive but was hoping for suggestions. 

Also, I’m used to Texas summers so the heat in some areas during that time period will not dissuade me from choosing a city."
bibelr,10hm5j0q,How to find a remote job at 17?,"Hi everyone! 

-apologies for the long post-

I’ve been very interested in transitioning to remote working for a long time now, but have found it very hard to find a good one due to being 17. 

A bit of background: I graduated about a year and a half early so have been doing independent study for the past couple months and will be starting university this fall. For someone my age, I’d say I have a good amount of experience: I’ve directed editorial shoots,  worked as a PA, tutored in Spanish, edited/translated content, been Key MUA for a movie, done some social marketing, I’ve been a hostess for two popular restaurants, and a couple other small gigs. I love writing but have only been published in small stuff so don’t think that’s something I can back up so well. I’m looking for a part-time job possibly in customer service but am open to options. I’m very interested in everything related to humanitarianism, sustainability, and animal rights, so any company that aligns with those values peaks my interest. 

I’ve already gone past the first phases with a couple companies but every time they find out my age they have to turn me away. One of them even said they think I’d be a good fit but can’t hire under 18. Or they decline me because I’m not far enough through university yet. 

My current job pays $12/hr which isn’t bad but soon I’ll be in charge of more financially and with a remote job I’d be able to work more hours without the hindrance of location or maybe earn a bit more. My father has been working remotely his entire life and I’ve seen the benefits from it first hand, so I think it’s a setup that I’d enjoy. I know there are unpaid internships more easily available, but I need to be earning an income since my parents can’t support me  entirely so those aren’t really an option for me at the moment.

I’ve been somewhat financially independent (I still live with my parents of course) since I was 14 and have always been the youngest amongst my coworkers. I always get comments on how I’m so young because I handle myself maturely and professionally. I say that because I realize many girls my age can be quite unprofessional or not want to put in the work, but I think for the most part I’m very reliable and self-sufficient. 

If anyone has any recommendations for where I should be looking or who I should be reaching out to that’d be greatly appreciated! Any information or advice is welcome :)"

I started a newsletter for remote openings with stock options at early-stage startups. Typically remote + equity roles are either not 1) well advertised, or 2) don’t mention whether equity is included. I have another newsletter where I interview founders after they raised a round of capital and I find out about these positions directly from them. Started the newsletter because I believe that remote staff should be granted equity – just like on-site staff. 

The newsletter is free, but people who choose to support the newsletter with an annual membership receive the newsletter ahead of time,  as well as company contact info and other good stuff (discounts from partners). 

The newsletter features a range of positions (Marketing, Business Development, Programming, Data Science).

-

My main criteria are:

Good internet

Cheap

-

Not too hot or at least not too humid

Beach (or some nature/green space)

Low pollution levels

Easy to get around

Cheap visa or visa free for UK citizen

-

At the moment my favourite options are:

Chiang Mai - ticking all my main criteria but I'm a little put off by it being busy/polluted

Hoi An - was here recently and loved it, but the cafés weren't that great and the visa exemption period is only 15 days for UK citizens

Penang - Sounds great and I get a full 90 day visa exemption, but I've heard there's not much of a DN community there.

I’ve read that people wait until a few days before arriving at a destination to book their airbnb to negotiate deals for a monthly rate. However, it seems that the chances of finding good places that aren’t booked at least one night in the upcoming month would be fairly slim. Also, booking flights last minute might leave fewer options and require us to get more expensive tickets.

However, part of the appeal of this lifestyle is the freedom and flexibility. If we like a city and want to stay longer (or vice versa), it would be nice to change plans as we’d like.

bo4mx6,,How To Rapidly Transform Into A Digital Nomad,"**Work on your personal discipline.**

&#x200B;

If you want the insane amounts of freedom that having a location-independent income makes possible for you... Then you'll really want to improve your personal habits ASAP. Make a decision today that your future-self will be happy about.

&#x200B;

**Personal habits such as:**

* Managing your energy well: Keeping a good sleep schedule, eating a decent diet, exercise, drink more water than booze, etc. Yes, you can ""skip this"" but you're going to have a lot of extra problems that you could easily avoid if you put these good habits in place when life is easy and predictable (although perhaps boring and unfulfilling)
* Doing work that will directly contribute to you making you money (using time productively vs. wasting it on Reddit)
* Eliminating and ignoring distractions + being able to identify what matters and what is noise

&#x200B;

**The business part is simple (but not exactly easy):**

* Make an attractive offer of a valuable service or product. If you don't have a valuable skill, learn one.
* Know how to reach your ideal clients/customers and how to convert that attention into sales (learn how to sell)

&#x200B;

If you never do all this  stuff you might still succeed (and good for you, really!) But you'll still have ""random"" annoying problems in your personal life which will show up in your business. 

&#x200B;

One of my favorite sayings: ""Any business problem is a personal problem in disguise.""

&#x200B;

More discipline = more freedom. 

Higher value / more attractive offer in your business, the easier it will be to sell.

&#x200B;

**Have a nice day and bon voyage!**"

1. Bangkok, Thailand
2. Never take the discounted tuk-tuk deal. The driver will just drive you around to stores, mainly tailors that they have an agreement with to get some kind of kickback. Very annoying and will waste your time. (Also can anyone explain the extra incentive? I was with my friend and he offered just to pay more money to not have to go through this to two different drivers and both tuk-tuks refused)
3. Using the Grab taxi app instead of hailing a taxi will be a much more enjoyable experience as you won't have to deal with someone taking the long way to run up the meter or someone saying that they don't do meter in order to charge you a crazy price."

You guys are the best. Great resource. Frequent lurker, rare poster.

I've been a DN for nearly two years. Curious about something. Do you watch Netflix / Amazon Prime / Hulu / whatever? How often? What shows?

Context: My guess is that online streaming with the DN community is much, much higher than the average person would guess. I'll go even further. For me, it's almost essential as a way to \*keep on keeping on\*, if that makes sense... yeah it's great to explore and slake wanderlust and hike mountains at sunrise --done plenty of that, will do plenty more--but Netflix (or whatever) is a dose of \*normalcy\* that's almost like comfort food. It's a regular diet of this comfort food that helps me do this long-term.

bqij8k,360zc1ao,Non-American Digital Nomads Traveling to the U.S.,"Hey r/digitalnomad, I'm hoping to hear experiences of or thoughts on non-American Digital Nomads Traveling through U.S. customs, specifically when you've planned on staying for a month or longer. 

When you're asked purpose of travel, do you explain the digital nomad thing? Or do you just pretend to be another tourist to keep things simple?

My girlfriend and I are both digital nomads. I'm American and she's Chinese. I have a legit part time job and she's an entrepreneur but hasn't formally started a company yet. 

I'm asking about digital nomad's experience thru US customs because my gf would like to visit the US longer and more often (twice a year at the most) than she has before. 

So far she's been fine staying for as long as 6 weeks at a time. She has a 10 year multiple entry B1/B2 U.S. visa and visited the US 4 times.

She has always said that she's just visiting as a tourist when asked by customs officials. I'm not sure though if this will work though this year with the following plan: July and August in the US (almost 60 days) then 30+ days starting mid November. That would be under 3 months between her stays in the US.

If she tries that plan, do you think in November she should say that she's visiting for tourism again or try to explain the digital nomad thing? Keeping in mind she doesn't have an employer to back it up,  just some online payments from the platforms she teaches for online.

This won’t be my first rodeo. I’m well travelled, lived over seas and did a 3 month trip out west a few years ago, but stayed mostly in a tent. This time around it will be for a longer stretch(year or more) and I’m buying a 30’+ used RV.  I do plan on taking my two old cats as well. I can’t leave them. They’re old. 



My plan is to head west to the Rockies until it gets too cold and then the desert for the winter. I’d like to stay at least a month in whatever location I’m at. I’ve am a passionate hiker, backpacker and all around outdoor enthusiasts so I’d like to do a lot of exploring. 

I’ve lived with people my whole life so I’m accustom to living with strangers but I’m not chatty or extrovert.

One way to go about this is to use a VPN of course.

Did anyone find a good country to browse through where:

* Bandwidth and latency hit is minimal. Since this depends on where you are located geographically I guess there should be one preferred country per continent.
* Minimal amount of content blocking/filtering
* Minimal degree of local search results by search engines
* Minimal amount of government/ISP tracking
* Defaults to English in most websites


I would love to hear your experiences as you have been visiting different countries and browsing the web.

Maybe we can collaborate on getting together a top list of the best countries to browse the web through when on the go?

I have not looked into this myself yet but based on experience and [this map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Countries_with_English_as_Official_Language.png) my best guesses per continent of my interest would be:

* Europe: Ireland
* East/Southeast Asia: India? Singapore should be the best for connectivity, but again, privacy. Hong Kong is a mixed bag of Chinese and English.
* North America: Canada (Still part of Five Eyes, so privacy is bad)
* South America: Guyana
* Africa: ?
* West Asia: ?

My spontaneous guess is that small island nations would be the best to avoid local results, but worst in terms of connectivity.
As suggestions come in I will edit this post to include the best options."

bu62vf,2lw98ihk,"Cuenca, Ecuador and Antigua, Guatemala (in July, August)","Hi all, I am trying to decide on my next destination from the end of june until the end of august / early September. I'm relatively new to being a nomad (since last November) and have been going to latin american destinations, as I work on US time zones, and have a goal of learning a second language (Spanish) to be able to go to many different places on earth and speak with the locals. My first 2 destinations were Medellin Colombia and Playa Del Carmen Mexico. After being on the beach, I want to return to the mountains. I have narrowed down my choices to Cuenca, Ecuador, and Antigua, Guatemala. I would love to hear anyone's experience in either of these 2 places to help make my decision. Here is some more information on what I am looking for:

&#x200B;

**Weather / Climate**

I am looking for a green mountainous destination as both of these places are. I would love to see some active volcanoes / recent eruptions, as are closer in proximity to Antigua. This landscape entices me a bit more, but Cajas and Banos close to Cuenca seem great as well, and I could probably make a trip to an active volcano in Ecuador. I understand that this will be the rainy season in Guatemala, but from what I read it is not that severe in Antigua, with sunny mornings and rainy evenings. The sun is very important to me, without it I don't feel as happy. But it seems that there is often a dry spell in July and the rest of the time I can count on some sunlight in the morning. It seems to be that it will be the drier sunnier season in Ecuador at this time. But the temperature seems a little warmer in Antigua, which is nicer. But sunny and a little colder would be better than cloudy and a little warmer.

&#x200B;

**Spanish / Cultural Immersion**

So from what I see, Antigua is more of a touristic bubble with a lot of english spoken, and maybe a bit harder to get a feel for true Guatemalan culture. But I am sure that with some effort I could get to know some Guatemalans and get a better feel. I don't really have time for spanish school, and feel i took a small step backward in this aspect going from medellin to playa del carmen. After playa, I think Antigua would be better for spanish and cultural immersion, maybe more along the lines of Medellin (El Poblado). My spanish is intermediate, I can carry conversations and usually get my point across, but usually can't follow everything in a conversation. I have been told that going somewhere with little English, such as Cuenca, would be better for my Spanish learning. But I admit that I am a little afraid to go somewhere alone where I don't speak the language well. But Cuenca would be a deeper dive into local culture I feel than a touristic smaller town like Antigua. I have been reading up on the history of both places and am very fascinated by both.

&#x200B;

**Coworking / Community**

I feel more productive at a coworking space, and like to be social, and as I am travelling alone, don't want to be on my own in a strange place. I have seen Impact Hub Antigua and Coworking Cuenca as good options. Anyone have experience at either of these places? I would prefer a sense of community and be able to meet people for weekend hiking trips / the occasional night out on the town. I am also a little nervous to go to coworking space where everyone would only speak Spanish, not yet sure if I would meet bilingual locals / other international english speakers at these locations, particularly in Cuenca. 

&#x200B;

**Safety**

Based on the research I have done so far, both of these places have issues with petty theft but not too much serious violent crime. I can be careful to not take more than I need with me, but as a foreigner travelling alone I am a target. I hope to be safe walking in busy areas alone during the day. Antigua seems small enough that I can stay in the toursitic zone. In Cuenca, I am wondering if anyone has input on safe neighborhoods. I would prefer to be able to walk both to my coworking space and some restaurants/nightlife (before too late at night). I was recently robbed at knifepoint in a taxi in playa del carmen, so I would like to use an application for safe taxi / uber at night. It seems Easy Taxi is in Cuenca, I have seen posts on uber trips from guatemala city airport to antigua, but not sure about an app for a ride home from the bar at night in Antigua. 

&#x200B;

All in all, I think that both of these destinations will be on my list of places to go. I am just not sure which one to do first! I would love to hear any input from anyone who has spent time in either location."
bu65pp,8nqjx,Recommendations for places to visit in August/September possibly Greece or the Mediterranean.,"I will be traveling to Greece, Milos to be specific since I have some family that are going there. They will be there for about a month but after 2 weeks in Milos most of my family will be traveling to different islands, bouncing around every two days or so.

I have done this travel schedule in the past and it is exhausting. Plus didn't want to feel like they had to cater to my work schedule when they should be enjoying their vacation!

My sister and her husband will then be going to Crete for 2 weeks and they both work remotely - they invited me along but didn't want to be the younger brother that crashed a romantic get away. I told them this and they just laughed and said I was always welcome. So it is an option.

Then in late August to September I was going to go to Indonesia with them as well. So even if I do go to Crete I have about a month of unplanned time until Indonesia. 

So I was thinking about exploring more of Greece, or going to Indonesia earlier. The main problem with Indonesia is the time zone, I tell my company that I will always try to have at least 4 hours of overlap during the work day, with the 11 hour time difference that means working from 6pm-10pm which isnt too bad, just a minor inconvenience. 

So I figured I would reach out to the community here for suggestions on where would be an interesting place to go for a few weeks. Monthly budget after taxes is 5k USD. I don't want to spend nearly that much - usually I keep things under 2k a month and save/invest the rest."
bueo4l,ncjy4,credit/debit cards,"Just a question about credit/debit cards:

I recently switched my banking to N26. As a result I don't have a credit card anymore and I only have a debit card now. AFAIK I mostly used that credit card in my last year of traveling so I am wondering what are the odds of me having problems with this? I've also applied for a transferwise/revolut.


Just a few days ago I tried to pay for a bus trip and they only accepted credit cards / paypal. They also allowed debit for german account holders (I am not however N26 is a german bank) and it didn't work. I managed to solve it by using PayPal (which used my underlying N26 debit card to pay without any extra fees).

Will I be able to solve the credit card problem by using PayPal or e.g. using the free Revolut card? Or should I be looking into getting some other credit card. The latter does require opening another account at some bank though doesn't it?

I expect to fly at least 3 times a year minimum but I always try to go for cheap flights (mostly 100-200, sometimes 400+). I do tend to mostly get cash out at ATMs (N26 has no limit) and pay in local currencies instead of using my cards but willing to change that if there's an advantage to it."

So, I will be leaving for a 6-month journey as a DN family on Dec 1st.

We’re travelling with 2 kids (4 and 5). 

We’ll spend some time on Chiang Mai and Penang. 

Any other good suggestions? Looking for family-friendly places (beach is a plus), with good internet connection and nice environment. We love quiet places. Not to expensive too, but that should be pretty easy in SEA. 

As a reference, we LOVED our last stay in Boquete, Panama...it fits all our criteria except for the beach.

The interviewees include a:

* Tech entrepreneur from Silicon Valley who plans to go ‘back to the future’ and do the DN thing *again*.

* PR professional who sold her stuff, jumped on a sailboat, and now travels the world looking after peoples pets.

* Young man who skipped college, found work on Freelancer, and soon began traveling the world.

* Graphic design grad who couldn’t find work, attended a three-month web-dev ‘boot camp’, and landed his dream remote job.

Again, these individuals are all regular users of the very sub you are visiting right now. 

Real people with real stories of their own DN journey, exactly what I was looking for when I posted [the original thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/boew4k/would_you_be_willing_to_share_your_dn_story_for_a/).

I want to say a **huge thanks to this subreddit** and the hundreds of regular visitors around the world who post insightful and interesting comments here. You were an inspiration for me and I hope that this podcast series will serve as my way of 'giving back'. 

I've already received feedback from a surprising number of listeners from the first three episodes (the latest two were only released recently so no feedback yet) who have told me that they found the interviews inspiring, which means a lot to me.

I completely understand the cynicism which some people have towards DN podcasts and especially towards people like myself who seem to be using this sub to promote our own podcast (which I obviously am), but I think anybody who listens to the interviews released so far will see that there is value in people sharing their own stories in this format.

If you are interested in listening to the podcasts for yourself, you can [find them here](https://www.nomadskeptic.com/podcast/).

&#x200B;

Basically, I just graduated and want to travel the world while being able to support myself. I also think being able to make money from any location is a very, very useful skill to have.

&#x200B;

So, a little about myself.

I'm a 21y/o male and I just graduated a BSc in Psychology from the University of Amsterdam, with a fairly high GPA and honours.

Throughout my years I've been pretty good with computers, always trying to find ways to do things more efficient, making macro's etc. I've had an introductory course in programming through my university and I got an A+ without too much effort so I guess I have some talent for it and I loved doing it.

&#x200B;

I'm a native Dutch speaker, but I've been living with internationals for 3 years and I've been teaching English for a year.

Aside from this, I have experience teaching groups (in Psychology) and private tutoring (in High school courses).

&#x200B;

Basically, I don't have to make a career out of it, I just want to sustain myself during my travels. I want to leave around october/november so I'll have about 4-5 months to learn new skills and/or land a job to work online.

I've been looking in a lot of options like transcribing, translating, programming, teaching English, online skype-tutoring, etc.

Since I've got about 4-5 months, I do have a lot of time to build something. What would you guys suggest? Would this be enough time to learn programming and land a job in this? (or work freelance ofc)"

bvzcmc,3bq90yfx,Bangkok vs Phuket?,"Trying to decide on a place to go in Thailand. I understand these places are very different from each other, but I was wondering how they compare price-wise? It looks like both have plenty of options for cheap AirBnBs, but what are the neighborhoods like for both? I’m not big into partying, but it seems like you can live outside the center of Bangkok pretty cheaply, and the apartments there look peaceful. Most of them say that they are near a BTS or MRT stop. Does this mean that it would be relatively easy to visit central Bangkok/the main sights from these neighborhoods? Will these neighborhoods have plenty of restaurants/street food in them, as well? Also, should I be worried that some of these neighborhoods could be sketchy? What are the places to avoid in Bangkok? 

As for Phuket, the AirBNB prices seem good there, as well, but the locations are all over the place. Do you need a motorbike to get around there, or is it easy to go from place to place? I’d like to look for an apartment away from the party area but am worried I’ll be isolated. 

Lastly, what is everyone’s general impression of these cities? Is it possible to like either of them if I don’t want to party (not abstain from alcohol but, like, hang out with a casual drink and not club-hop)? Is Phuket overly touristy and light on culture/sightseeing? How does the food/cost of food compare to Bangkok?"

If i remember correctly, i need a return ticket to even enter the philippines, but upon entry ill only have a 30 day visa waiver, so it seems improper to have the return date on my ticket be in one year. Essentially, im asking if its alright that my return ticket will be a year from my arrival, or if its legal to arrive with a one way ticket and only the original 30 day visa waiver.

Secondly, are the extensions of stay for traveller visas (for all intents and purposes) guaranteed to go through? If i apply, am i basically guaranteed an extension as long as i do it far enough in advance? If not, what kind of things would cause me to be unable to extend my visa besides reaching the 36 month cap?

byyczj,z57tz,Advice for Long Term Plan for Becoming a Digital Nomad?,"Hey everyone,

&#x200B;

So I've been working on my life plan for the past couple of years. The exact details change from time to time, but what seems to stay constant is the plan falls into the realm of being a digital nomad. So I thought I would post my plan here to see what other digital nomads think.  


I'm from the U.S. and currently staying in Bogotá for the Summer to work on my Spanish and go rock climbing. When I go back home in August I'll be in my last year of my undergrad in Social Work. Then I'll take a gap year before I start my Master's to save up some money. Then I'll finish my Master's in a year, then work for two years to get my Social Work license. After I get my licensure, that's when I'll actually start my digital nomad era. 

I'm hoping to go into online counseling as a means to work remotely. My first destination would be Perú. Here I would further my Spanish as well as work part-time at an NGO that I have a connection.

My second destination would be Brazil for a year. Here I would like learn Portuguese while also formally studying the language either privately or through a university. 

Brazil would be followed by France for 1.5 years, learning French, then Italy for a year, then Spain for a year, formally studying the respective languages in at least France and Italy. 

At this point, I think I would like to incorporate translating documents online as a form of income as well. I might shift completely depending on how much freedom I have and what the pay difference would be. I think that translating documents would give me more freedom. From here I would just travel and live the nomadic life style, maybe working with NGOs along the way to bulster my resumé and do some good along the way. Eventually this would probably end with me trying to get a job at the U.N. doing either something related to Social Work or translating (or both?)

&#x200B;

Any thoughts on this plan? Any advice? I'm still about five years out until I actually start being a nomad, so there's still time to plan."

However I am still getting paid in the US and paying income taxes there. My company doesn’t mind paying me anywhere else in the world and I want to find a situation where I save on income taxes. A few of my friends work out of Dubai but there are stringent residency requirements there to ensure you actually live there if you get paid there. I am wondering if there are any countries in the world where you can “reside” for no or low income tax purposes but dont need to take up actual residence. A sort  of tax heaven for digital nomads. Does such a place exist?

&#x200B;

I am a little over a year into my career as a full-stack software developer. I am planning to leave to travel to Mexico indefinitely next fall (2020). I would like to take my work with me, which is technically doable. However, I acknowledge that I may have too little experience to request to become full-time remote from my employer. I am posting because I am seeking some advice on my game plan for requesting going remote. 

I do not plan on mentioning my intentions until next April, when I have my yearly review with the CEO (weird company structure means that each employee gets a 1-on-1 with the CEO annually). Tell him that I am going to move to Mexico City and would like to stay on as an independent contractor instead of an employee. If he says no, give him a one month(?) notice and leave the job after that.  I have been saving pretty aggressively and I will have around $40k to live on.

For those curious, I want to stay until at least the 2-year mark to make myself more employable if I decide to look for employment with another company.

One question I have is: should I bring it up earlier? But I am open to advice in other areas.

&#x200B;

My question is, given the fact that there are tests and so anyone else completing this homework can just mess with it until they pass all tests, which is what I will do, I am wondering what might I do to best stand out from everyone else?

I am Russian living in the Netherlands, finishing my AI masters and working as an NLP developer.

I would really appreciate some advice from people who have had experience working and living in different countries, changing locations every now and then while working for clients from Europe.

At the moment, in total I've been working for around 3+ years already and right now I have a one-person business here in the Netherlands and am doing some freelance work from time to time, thus paying taxes and all that. But as I am willing to become location independent, I'm planing to close my company and hence also lose my Dutch residence permit (getting a self-employed visa in the Netherlands is sort of hard since you need to prove that your business is innovative and bring value to the Dutch economy which doesn't seem to be the case at the moment :D). 

Does anyone have experience / knowledge about opening a company abroad while remaining location independent (e.g. not having to reside in the country where you register your business and not having to pay the rent / being registered at the municipality)? What's your experience in combining working and traveling? Could you share with me your experience with getting visas / paying taxes (if any) or registering as self-employed and traveling the world?

Was it that you moved to a new city/you don’t know anyone living near you? Is there a language barrier?

c4h8w0,fa0t7,Where to live in SE Asia?," 

Hello Digital Nomads! 

My SO and I are looking for ideas on places to live in SE Asia for a few months. Our current plan is to spend about 3 months in SE Asia, living in a different country each month. We know we want to do Vietnam (Danang) and Thailand, but are not sure about our third option. We originally thought about Bali, but after reading so many negative comments about Bali here I am not sure it’s worth it. We also are not sure about where in Thailand we want to choose yet, hopefully somewhere with a beach nearby. I was hoping to hear some of your ideas and the places you have liked living in SE Asia!

A little more background to get an idea of what we are looking for. The timeframe we are aiming for is between December and March. We both will be teaching English online and will (hopefully) earn about $3,000 a month ($1,500 each). We currently live in Taiwan and are looking for places with lower costs of living so we can save more money (or travel/have more fun). Low cost of living is very important since we will be heading to Europe after Asia and need to save for the cost of living difference. Plus we have a few trips in Asia we want to do before leaving. 

We love hiking, rock climbing, and going to the beach. So we are looking for destinations that have at least some of these things, beaches being the most important. We enjoy snorkeling and are getting our Scuba certification before we leave Taiwan and hoping to do some diving during these 3 months. So places with diving available nearby is a huge plus. I know there is a lot of diving in Thailand so hopefully while we are there we can do that. We aren’t huge partiers, but after living in Taiwan for so long we would definitely enjoy some more nightlife. Not much of a drinking culture here so a place we can go for a couple drinks after a long day is also a plus. 

So, what have been some of your favorite places in SE Asia that might have some of what we are looking for? We’d also love some recommendations on cities/places in Thailand too, so we can finalize that. Thanks in advance for any help!"

c4wirt,11dpa9u,"On loneliness, again","\~3 min read.

Two weeks ago, I started researching on loneliness. I made a few [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/c2hp5q/do_you_feel_lonely_while_remote_working/) on different social media and received lots of feedback (mostly from reddit/digitalnomad, thank you!). I've come to the following conclusions: 

* Loneliness works as a negative feedback loop: feeling lonely affects your body and mind in such a way that you feel less capable of interacting with others. Higher perceived cost of interacting -> less interactions. This continuing lack of interactions makes you feel even lonelier. 
* Physical interactions are a must. Hopefully, VR/AR/other technology will effectively replace social interactions, but nothing today seems to do the trick. 

These two conclusions together indicate that a product/service that solves the loneliness problem should incentivize people to meet and interact in person. After researching, I’ve come up with the following conclusions of attributes that incentivize people to meet in person:

* Meetings in groups instead of 1on1s. 1on1s feel stressful/high-pressure
* People must have a main interest/hobby/sport/activity in common. Meeting for the sake of interacting, instead of to engage in a shared interest, puts too much pressure in the participants. It’s easier if interacting is not seen as the sole goal of the event/meeting/gathering.
* Details of the meeting must be clear and reliable. The time, place, and attendees of the meeting should be respected. Uncertainty about the meeting creates stressful speculations on the mind of a lonely person (what if no one shows up? What if I don’t find the people and have to bug them to tell me the exact location?)

Meetup.com satisfies most of the requirements. For those not familiar with meetup, it basically lets you create a location-based group around an interest/hobby like ‘Frisbee players NYC’. People can join groups and assist events or “meetups”. However, I have found it has the following shortcomings: 

* Lack of accountability -> lots of people put ‘attending’ but don’t show up
* Lack of focus around people wanting to make new friends. Many meetups are work/career related. These aren’t ideal environments to make new friends. Many other meetups are around a hobby/interest, but the attendants aren’t necessarily looking to make new friends. 

The attributes discussed above + meetup.com’s shortcomings made me come up with a  meetup.com-like webapp with some additional features to solve the loneliness problem:

* A cost to not showing up to a meeting you said you would attend. This cost could be either monetary or social (i.e. your account’s assistance is known. Meetings could have an ‘assistance rate requirement’ for those who wish to attend).
* A group chat that helps people break some ice before they meet in person.

I know this is a long post with a kinda copycat solution, but I think a solution with these properties could help lonely people have meaningful interactions that would break their negative feedback loops. What do you think?"

I'll make sure we have a set agreement prior to doing any work in the future. Also, he works for his dads real estate company that will be implementing the software once it's done, so it's not just some kid with just an idea. Thanks for all the advice 

Okay so I just graduated college with a solid GPA and my bachelors in computer science. I never had any internships although I had a job doing basic HTML/JS work. I have lots of experience from classes alone.

I'm interviewing for full-time jobs but in the meantime I decided to do some freelance work at [Upwork.com](https://upwork.com/) to pay the bills. I found a project pretty quick building a web application from scratch in HTML/JS and it took me approx. 20 hours to do (\~17 hours of work, 3 hours learning) as it was a bit complicated. It's basically just a web application with a form that takes in the clients details for a real estate transaction and is used to create a Word .doc which can be downloaded from the browser. I've attached screen shots of the site so far (just need to improve the UI and add one more feature then i'm done).

The issue is that the client is a 19 year old who said he has a low budget but will give equity in the software as he plans to sell it to companies to use. So I will continue to work on it - add in backend dev like registration/login and eventually payment.

But for now, he's going to pay me for what I have currently. I see rates on reddit and [upwork](https://upwork.com) anywhere from $30-150+/hr for freelance work. Can anyone give me an estimate for how much I should ask for what I have currently?

Here's a pic of the site and then a pic of the created word doc that was downloaded:

[https://imgur.com/a/uFvvpfm](https://imgur.com/a/uFvvpfm)

Would appreciate any ideas as I have no clue what to charge lol. We decided that we would agree on a price once I was close to finishing as I was unsure how long it would take.

\*\*\*I realize that I should have agreed upon a price before working on it but oh well :( I really am mostly just looking for number estimates - like a range of what I should charge for what I have so far.

c5qwl3,6gbwg,I finally got a remote job! Going on a limb and asking if anyone is interested in traveling with me,"I’ve been planning this for years and it’s finally come true. I start my job end of July but would like to train for a bit before getting on the road. Probably mid-September. I’m currently in Boston/Cambridge. After this, I’d like to road trip all over the US and stay in Airbnb’s and in my car. Hopefully able to hit all 50 states (obviously have to fly to Hawaii and Alaska tho). After that I’d like to go to other countries. Maybe start in Europe and head over to Asia? 

These plans are super flexible as you can imagine. My main gripe is wanting to have someone to do them with. I don’t mind being alone and I can make friends pretty easily, but it would be nice to have a steady travel buddy. 

PS I’m a 28yo girl and open to traveling with any gender. We’d of course have to see how well we’d get along, etc. but it’s not a huge commitment either way since I plan to do this whether I have a partner or not :D"

c62rrd,3ubjg5f9,"How do you deal with your parents, being a DN?","My parents do support me with what I do and are proud of me, but the problem is me living abroad. I've even living abroad for over 8 years now, and my parents were never happy about it, especially my Mom. There were times we had screaming matches, or she would say things like 'You're crazy, I hope you realize that one day and come back home'. She would constantly make me feel bad about living far away, especially when I lived about 11 flight hours away from home. These days I live only 2.5 flight hours away and there happier about it, but they keep pointing out how they really hope I'll never move away further than that again. And still, my Mom cries every single time they drop me off at the airport. I'm not blaming them completely, I understand how hard it must be to not see your kid all the time, but I also don't wanna make decisions in my life only based on their happiness. I talk to my parents almost every day o WhatsApp, and call them like once a week, and at the moment I come visit like every three months.

The thing is, that I'm planning to move further away in a few months. It will be more than 11 flight hours even. I don't know for how long, could be a couple of years if I like it. I'm just already dreading that conversation with my parents so much, and I feel bad and guilty about it again.

c6gd8c,4tn60,Nomads who teach online,"Hi all! I've done a cursory search for previous posts on this topic both here and on the online TEFL subreddit, but I haven't found quite what I'm looking for. I just started nomading while teaching online in Southeast Asia, and I'm finding that access to fast, dependable internet will end up significantly limiting where I can travel. My online teaching schedule is five days a week, so I will basically always need to stay in a place that has good internet (at least 5 mbps both up- and download, of course more is better). So far, Saigon was okay, but Dalat, Vietnam has been a nightmare, great for watching movies, but terrible for teaching. From what I've read about Laos and Cambodia, both of those countries might not be possible for me at all. In Thailand, there's Chang Mai, and I've even read that Bangkok's internet has been going downhill lately. What's a traveling online teacher to do? Even in places where it seems fast at first, it winds up disappearing sometimes, the signal going in and out. This is not a big deal for things like writing, but it's terrible for online teaching. It seems to me our situation is a bit different than that of other nomads because we can't just go to a cafe or coworking space to solve our internet woes. So, to all the online teachers out there, what cities have provided you with what you need to properly teach online with confidence that your internet will work? How have you solved your internet problems? I just got one of those 4G hotspot thingies, so I'm hoping that will help, but that leads to the issue of having to get different sim cards every time they run out or I change countries. Thanks for any input you can share! Hopefully this thread will serve as a resource for other nomading online teachers."

I'm a senior front-end developer with 18 years of experience, of which 4 years of being a consultant in the Amsterdam (the Netherlands) area.

Tech profile TL;DR: All things web, React, TypeScript, I'm in love with the visual aspects of my job and I pride myself on being very fast, high quality, and pixel-perfect in my work. And as you can read I'm also the most modest person in the world ;)

My GF lives in Mexico City and I'm joining her there for 6 months (the maximum stay is 180 days), and I'm keeping my rental appartment in Amsterdam. We're giving the relationship a stress-test, basically.

I might be working for any of three companies (I have 3 offers already):

1. A company from the USA (fully remote), consultancy.
2. A company from Colombia (office in CDMX), product company.
3. A company from Mexico (fully remote), product company.

All three look to be interesting in their own rights for different reasons, so they are all equal to me.

### First question: Legal

Being a Dutch citizen (the Netherlands), my country has a treaty with Mexico. Tax-wise I can work from within Mexico and, apparently, that means that Mexico can ask me to pay income taxes. My Dutch tax agency tells me that this supercedes any visa restrictions; I would not need a working visa because of this treaty.

But when I look into the details I'm thrown back and forth between ""You're in a gray tax-dodging situation that governments haven't caught up to yet"", and ""You need to pay taxes to the Netherlands"", and ""You need to pay taxes to Mexico.""

Income taxes in the Netherlands are significantly higher than in Mexico. And I would not enjoy paying taxes to a country where I don't physically live for the next 6 months. I'd rather pay Mexico.

Where can I find clear cut and final answers to this matter? I've consulted tax professionals and lawyers and even they don't seem to have caught up with the digital nomad kind of working...

### Salary

- The Colombian company is offering $5000 USD net per month at 40hrs/week.
- The company from the USA is *suggesting* $5000 USD gross per month at 40hrs/week.
- The Mexican company is offering $4500 USD net per month at 40hrs/week.

I have further negotiations planned for later today with the US-based company. Their initial salary suggestion is significantly lower than both the other two. 

As a digital nomad, I would understand that we aren't getting SF or NYC or even Amsterdam kind of incomes. We're competing with remote workers from India and South America. I understand and respect that, me being a blonde European doesn't mean anything. 

Still, what kind of salary range could I negotiate for? I was honestly expecting them to go up to $12,000 USD/month (gross), or at least higher than $7000 USD/month (gross). Their clients are big corporate multi-billion Dollar giants. What they make off of me isn't my business, but at the very least I expected them to compete with South American offers. And they don't.

Any tips, tricks, pointers, advice, or even just understanding would be much appreciated. And if you find yourself in CDMX the first beer is on me."

c6n3ya,3fi892,"Curious how many with ""weak passports"" and come from poorer countries are successful as DNs.. and how did you do it? I wanna read your success stories and maybe even get some advice :)","Just like the title says, I'm basically interested to know if people with similar circumstances can make it as a digital nomad. I feel a little disheartened as my previous attempts of becoming a DN weren't too successful, and that some people probably have it easier when it comes to moving around more freely. I love my current office job and it pays really well for someone based here in the Philippines, but I don't get much time off outside of holidays and I feel like I'm missing important life experiences while I'm still capable (I'm 32 and have been to 6 countries since 2012..late bloomer I guess).

I've always loved the idea of being a DN myself, and thought as a writer it would be easier as you can literally write from anywhere in the world. But unfortunately I come from a country where passports are weak and foreign exchange rates aren't too great. I could only earn so much to support myself at minimum in a foreign country before going broke. A potential foreign employer once even laughed in my face when he found out I was from the Philippines and wouldn't give me my asking salary (it was a work from anywhere position), and many other potential clients and employers tend to lowball me and my peers because the cost of living here is significantly lower. If we intend to stay in the country, sure maybe it's doable, but I do want to have a certain amount of freedom to work while traveling the way most of you are doing.

I figured maybe once I figure out all the budgeting and schedules, as well as finding a job that allows me to work from anywhere, I could start with traveling to visa-free countries first and work my way to countries that require visa applications in order to stay for a month or longer. Additionally, I've recently been disabled, for 6 months now, so physical jobs aren't a possibility. I could walk and get on planes with wheelchair assistance, but my mobility is very minimal and crucial to my healing, so for now work involving laptops are my best bet.

Would love to read your stories and get any advice! :)"

c7fjtw,rgonfuk,Alternatives to Thailand ?,"I'm passing through SE Asia this summer/fall. My plan atm is to hop Japan -> SK -> Taiwan and then go  somewhere in those genocide-scarred area between/in the South China sea and the Andamana sea.

&#x200B;

Thailand is the obvious spot but it has a few disadvantages, namely the fact I can only travel there for 15 days without getting a visa and that it's apparently quite expensive.

&#x200B;

What attracts me to that area is:

&#x200B;

* Amazing beaches & bodies of water
* Impressive looking vegetation
* Monkeys, I'd fucking love to hang out with monkeys
* Foreigner friendly\~ish (as in, people know a tiny bit of English, you can find local guides to show you around, loads of digital nomads)

&#x200B;

The main drawbacks I see are:

* Malaria carrying mosquitoes
* Heavily contaminated carrying water/food 
* Any other combination of insects, reptiles, aquatic animals, plants and other humans trying to kill or seriously injure me

As far as I see, the touristy area of Thailand ... and most of the country in general, have none of the drawbacks. But I'm bothered by the visa and price issue.

&#x200B;

Is there an equivalent to Thailand that is just as beautiful whilst being reasonably safe ? I don't mean hedge-fund child safe, I grew up in Eastern Europe, so to some extent I can deal with unsafe areas of cities, scams, I can haggle, I know when someone wants a bribe... etc. However, what I'm mainly afraid of are the things listed bellow that I can't control, chiefly among which is disease, or, even worst, a combination or poor access to quick flight to western Europe/Japan and disease (after all, one could always catch Malaria or even some forms  of encephalitis, get to a western hospital, and be somewhat fine).

&#x200B;

On the other hand, I feel like many of the countries around, whilst being quite stunning, don't have quite the variety and natural beauty I've seen in Thailand. But I'm talking only  from hearsay and documentary footage."
c7jco1,hhlx5,Too many backpacks?,"I’ve was in SE Asia for about a year and a half before visiting home again. While I’ve been here I’ve upgraded my pack to the Aura 65L because the Stratos 26L was a bit too small to do all the things I want to do (backpacking, camping, and traveling to colder climates). 

Now that I’m headed back to Asia in a couple of days and truly starting my digital nomad life, I’m worried about what bags to bring back with me.

I’m toying with the idea of taking the 65L bag as a checked bag and the 26L as my carryon. I also have a 15” Fjallraven Kanken and was gifted an Osprey daylite pack. 

I adore the Kanken as a day bag for when I have to work as it has a designated laptop pocket, but I like the Osprey as it’s lighter and more comfortable. 

I like the small size of the 26L for shorter jaunts around the region but I feel like I will need the 65L for when I do more outdoor intensive activities. Because I will be. 

I feel ridiculous bringing so many bags around with me (even though the two smaller bags can absolutely fit inside the bigger bags) but is it silly to carry around a 65L and a 26L both? I’m a digital nomad but I tend to travel like a typical backpacker. Buses, trains, and shitty planes. 

Will carrying both bags be too cumbersome? How much is too much?"

c88sug,3kxhu8bx,Anyone know a straightforward way to find companies that hire remotely without using job boards?,"It's my firm belief that job boards are a waste of time. For example I saw a posting on linkedin today that had over 200 applicants. When that many people apply whoever gets the job is pure luck. I like to hunt for companies I want to work for and then approach them, because by the time something makes it to Indeed or LinkedIn I'm competing with way to many people. 

When dealing with brick and mortar businesses this is pretty easy. I find a company I like and try to figure out how they're hurting. With remote work this is much more difficult. I guess I'm looking for a good list of companies that are either entirely remote to begin with or known to hire remote workers.

I  landed at Cebu, was there for a few days but it was too gritty for me so I moved myself to Dumaguete. Couldn't find a decent apartment for one month stay (or any other good reason to stay, frankly) so decided to move to Tagbilaran, Bohol and this is where I am now. I chose these places  because they had coworking places (Which are very rare in the  Philippines) and maybe nice beaches nearby for the days off. But on arrival I found out renting accommodation is not easy. Not many places offer to rent for one month, and the ones that do are not cheap nor offer good value for money.  Especially compared to what you can get in Thailand for the same price for example. Which makes me  think Philipines was a rookie mistake and maybe I should just get on the  next flight to Bangkok.   
Before I do, figured I'll ask here to see maybe someone has an idea for me.  
If anyone can recommend a place in the Philippines that includes the following:   
1. Coworking place / Good cafes to get work done

cav8ww,,Reliable hotspot device to use while on the road?,"I'm looking for a hotspot device that will give me reliable wifi connection while I am traveling in the continental US. 

My previous trips, wifi has been limited to airbnb rooms, starbucks, or public libraries. Each of these have their limitations, whether hours of operation or the cost of renting... I want to be a little more free and be able to work while car camping (that is, not super back-country) or hanging out somewhere in the outdoors.

I don't really know where to start though. I could enable hotspot on my cell phone plan but that uses my cell battery and I would rather have a separate device that I could turn off and on as needed.

Has anyone used anything like this before? What are your recommendations? Any stories to share?"

ccqnh8,voay2,Trying to talk a US client into paying me through Transferwise's borderless account.,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I'm a freelance translator located in Spain.

For four years, I've been working with a client located in the US that pays me monthly.

At first, we tried PayPal. Their fees were a big no-no, so then we switched to the regular expensive wire transfer to my bank account in Spain: (My client's bank, Santander Bank, charges them $30-35, plus, I'm charged $20 + 15€ + markup on exchange rate).

So, I've been trying to sell them the Transferwise option.

I opened a borderless account and asked my client to add me to their direct deposit payroll system. I figured that because I now have a USD balance, they could do that easily and it would save us both those monthly exorbitant fees.

My client refused the option because, apparently, in order to add me to the direct deposit payroll system, they should issue a 1099 form for which I would need an SSD that I don't or can't have as a Spanish citizen.

Maybe it was my fault because I asked him to add me to their direct deposit payroll system. I should have just asked him to send the monthly transfer to my Transferwise's USD balance instead of my bank account in Spain, but now that I have suggested it, my client sticks to his 1099 form and SSD argument.

So I just wanted to ask whether he's right and he just can't do it or, if he's not right and there's a chance for him to make transfers in USD from his Santander Bank to my Transferwise's USD balance, I would kindly ask you to advise me on how I can talk him into using it, because I'm really running out of arguments.

My partner and I have been working our way around Europe for the last couple of months but have so far been undecided on where to spend our time in August. We'll be working on a writing project in Arles until the end of July, and then looking to spend at least two weeks in the same location, but we're willing to stay up to a month.

Preferably, we'd be able to get an Airbnb for €600-700 for two weeks, but we can go a bit higher if need be. So far, we've considered Bordeaux, Strasbourg, Nantes and Montpellier but we haven't been able to decide on which place. Our workload is probably going to be quite full, but we typically enjoy cities with decent restaurants, contemporary art galleries, and fairly active nightlife, although our budget isn't enormous at the moment. I should also mention that we're not totally against leaving France altogether for the right place.

It'd be great if anyone who has spent time here during this busy period can offer any advice on what would be a great next move. Thanks for your help!"

I started learning Spanish with duolingo, and then started with a private tutor in my first nomad destination in Colombia. I continued taking private lessons online with this tutor for a while, and it was going well. But recently they have been overloaded with work and dont have time to squeeze in a couple of one hour sessions with me a week when they have other students with more time available. I travel for work every few months and have been changing locations on tourist Visa in between, so finding a private tutor in each location seems like more work than is necessary. I've tried to pick up with duolingo but am way past the level I was the last time and most other apps I have looked into are more beginner level focused. I made a lot of good progress from beginner to intermediate, but seem to have hit a wall in trying to get from intermediate to advanced. I'm asking other nomads out there who have learned Spanish while on the go and working each day how they did it and if you have any advice for me. I get a lot of practice, and my conversational abilities with my current vocabulary range are ok, but I'm having trouble expanding my vocabulary and grammar lately.

I am hoping to have this completed in 6-12 months as It appears that the most likely way to be a DN is through this type of work.

I just hit my mid 30s, have a Philosophy degree and have been working in legal support for a large law firm. I have been working 6-7 days a week for over a year and a half with another 3-5 years left to hit my LeanFIRE goals. Being a DN would greatly reduce working as much as I do and potentially help save even more than all the hours I put in now.

I started out with LeanFIRE goals but came to the conclusion that getting out there and experiencing what the world has to offer is the most important goal.

1. How realistic is it of me to expect to be hired remotely after learning basic coding/how much can I expect to earn? (I have some remote work experience as I would do it every now and then from a previous position)

2. Any tips on what I should be learning to be DN status?

cepwjv,lgst5h,Artist digital nomads looking to transition to SQL,"If anyone has any guidance and insight on the path to get there and how to do this, would be greatly appreciated.

Some background: 

25, recently graduated with a Game Art bachelor degree (I told my parents art didn't giving a flying rat's ass about degrees, but they're very traditional. So here I am with a degree that does nothing). I have supported myself purely through online commissions throughout this time and could hold fairly decent. However, as I'm now out looking for a traditional job (also purely through external pressure), I'm confronted with the dull reality that art jobs are simply not in demand. As rent and other prices are increasing too fast (last year my rent skyrocketed by 400 dollars) my online earnings is struggling to earn enough to support myself.

Fast forward to me skimming this subreddit: I've heard that SQL is something that IS in demand. I'm not entirely new to programming. I've scripted a few simple games in unity including pong, brick break, a small fps with enemy waves, and a shoddy clone of a bullet hell. I do know html, css, basic game level c# and c++ (nothing mathematically complex, just stacking simple if statements) and am currently learning: javascript, python and ruby. SQL had never entered my pursuit before, but from what I've read up upon, it's about data management and organisation. I do enjoy the idea of that so....

My question is: What is the path to getting an entry level job in SQL?  How long will it take for one who might invest 5-10 hours a week in study to get there? How should I go about this pursuit? If this career path is not suitable, what are other options for me that might be viable?

(And just in case anyone wonders why this is in digitalnomad: I'm generally on the move all the time and haven't stayed very long in one area. Online jobs suit me and it's what I've always done and have kept me flexible in moving with friends who have stricter area requirements)

Thank you in advance!

Tl;dr: artists are poor, jobs are competitive, rent is rising. SQL is in demand, supposedly, and training myself for this could be a possibility to solve all my problems. Help? Guidance? Tips? Critiques?"

cerrqr,2xg70qs7,"My Secret ""Digital Nomad Rule"" to Optimizing Fulfillment","Forgive the dramatic title. I'm practicing copy-writing. 

**TL;DR: Don't hangout with too many ""travelers or transients."" Find locals wherever you are that won't leave. If you do meet travelers/transients make sure you are leaving the destination before them. You only have so much social energy so spend it on those people that have a higher potential for ROI. Travelers/transients leave, whereas locals will always be in the same city for you to return to.** 

In the past couple months I've implemented a new rule into my life which has REALLY increased my fulfillment in this digital nomad journey. For reference I'm over 2 years in, 15 countries. I spent the majority of my time in Bulgaria or Thailand. 

Before I explain the rule, let me share with you some backstory. 

When I first started traveling, I was in unpopular non-digital nomad hotspots in Europe. If I was in a digital nomad hot-spot I never hung around digital nomads. It just so happened like that. 

In the past year however I've been in more popular digital nomad areas such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Bali. I've also done more travel compared to my first year, where I spent the majority of my time in Bulgaria. 

When I went to Bali I observed myself going through emotional highs n' lows. 

One day was heaven, the next day was hell. Wtf was going on? 

*I realized I was hanging around too many transient people.*

My first week for example in Bali was *heaven.* I made a few friends and we instantly had an epic group. Then, they left. 

And I proceeded to have a so-so week where I was either alone or with people I didn't really connect with.

The same happened in Thailand. A lot of these cheaper countries attract so much tourism, and the tourists are often the easiest people to meet because of their openness. The problem comes when your social interactions become too transient/meaningless or you get tired of constantly meeting new people. 

In my first month in Chiang Mai I made 2 amazing friends- then they both left after. One didn't even bother to say ""good-bye"" or schedule a final meeting (despite us meeting so often and even working on a fun mini-project together). Luckily the other guy didn't leave with such poor style. 

That moment is exactly when it clicked: the reason why I enjoyed living in Bulgaria compared to Bali or Thailand was because my friends were local & never left. It is why Sofia feels like home to me- those people are there to welcome me every time I return. 

Here's the challenge about being a digital nomad then: 

Meeting other digital nomads & travelers are super easy because you can relate the most. But they also are the most likely to leave you if you're staying in a place longer, and if you decide to return to said city then you have to re-discover new friends. 

I think this reason alone is why some people burn out of digital nomadism faster than others (besides personal preference ofc). If every 2-4 weeks you need new friends, even if you're staying in one city, that is sure to drain anyone! 

**My digital nomad rule now is no transient people. I only meet locals or expats or someone who is staying in the city for an extended period of time, but if I know they're leaving soon I won't give them as much time as someone local.** 

It doesn't sound good at all... Though if you're a real digital nomad I'm sure you'll relate to this. 

Also I'm not saying *never* to hangout with transients or digital nomads. You just need to prioritize which ones you meet. 

I'd say when you're in a city 80% locals/expats and 20% digital nomads/travelers is the way to go. 

Of course digital nomads are great to meet in a way because you can meet later in other cities. One DN I met in Europe last year will link up with me in Asia in a few days. That's great. 

But the vast, vast majority of DN's & travelers are on their own path and even if you two link up they may leave on their own. 

Finally another thing I'll do is only hangout with transient/traveler types if it's in the context of locals/expats. For example I'm friends with another expat here and together we hung-out with a few guys traveling through the city. 

Even though they left, it's okay because the experiences with them were shared with someone else here.

One final thing I'll add is that sometimes the rules deserve to be broken. This isn't a strict rule. 

For this period of my life right now I don't hangout with travelers or transients because I'm slowing down big time and tired of meeting new people. I rather meet a local, and even if I leave I know I can come back and they'll probably still be here. 

This may help you if you're struggling socially when it comes to digital nomadism. 

This isn't easy, either. Like I mentioned travelers/transients are easiest to meet..

It's GREAT that it's hard though. All gems are worth fighting for. 

For example I met an expat living in the same city as me for 10+ years. He's somehow able to meet me basically whenever I am free. 

Why? He's weird. He creeps out girls. Etc. 

Sometimes the easiest-to-meet people are also the least valuable people. They're easy to meet *because they are creepy, etc.* In fact unless they're a traveler it's a red flag if people are too available to meet. 

So you'll have to certainly develop some more social skills & take some risks when it comes to meeting locals/expats with pre-established social circles. 

It isn't easy... But for me it's been a ton more fulfilling.

P.S. Again there are modifications for this and it's not strict. It's just my 2-cents of a long-term traveler that meeting other travelers, despite being easiest to relate to, also make you the most lonely."
ceru26,tra6e,How to build remote team of strangers to create a product?,"Hey guys 👋

I have been thinking about something like this for some time.

So I have some idea for a hobby project, but that is not really important. The important part is the process of execution/development of it. I would like to find 2 to 3 people (from anywhere) who would join this project and we would work together on it.  🤝

The project is web application, so each person would need to have specific skills related to software/web design and development. I am web developer, I have worked on some similar projects, so I have an idea how the team should look. The problem is, where should I look for people who would join something like this? 

Here are some bullet points about the whole project:
- there would NOT be any wage/payment (hopefully in future if the project succeeds)
- nothing to expect from it (money wise)
- main goal is to find new friends to share and LEARN new things with (maybe in future, this team would build successful product)
- it would be a hobby project
- goal of the product itself is to build it to a form that can be presented to investors (from MVP to working product)
- to have “nice” project on github for CV/portfolio
- I have small budget for production deployment (to cover hosting and related costs)
- backend developer / frontend developer / designer
- scrum driven development
- in terms of technologies to use, I am thinking along these lines: Rails/Laravel/NodeJS, React/Vue
- there would be set amount of hours for week that one can offer (let’s say 5h/week)
- lots of online communication/collaboration

Actually, if anyone is interested to talk about this, write me a message or just comment here.

Any tips are much appreciated!"

I’ve travel a lot but never as a DN and now I’m closer to being one. Every time I’m abroad I used to connect from the hostel, Airbnb or a coffee shop.

cfgeq7,52j9a,Any advice on short term (~2 month) catastrophic gap coverage for US citizen moving back to the states temporarily?,"I'm moving back to the US for 2 months. I have national health insurance in the country I currently live in, but that ends the day I leave back to the US. I'll have national coverage once again when I get to the next country I'm moving to. But in between, I'll be in the US for 2 months (actually a bit less), and I want to have some cheap catastrophic coverage (in case I get in a car accident and need to have major surgery or whatever).

I've checked a number of places, but most (if not all?) of the coverage options I've seen (e.g. ehealthinsurance.com, etc) have a clause that you have to have lived in the US for the last 12 months.

I thought about getting insurance through something like worldnomads, but it's like 500 bucks for 2 months in the US and covers more than I need.

Really I'd be fine with basically any size deductible, I just want a maximum out of pocket around 10-20k so I don't loose everything I've worked for if I get in an accident or something. **edit:** ballpark I'm looking for 50-100 a month. Again, I don't care about medicine, doctors visits, etc, just want catastrophic coverage. 

Does anybody have any advice? Just to be clear, because it always seems to be the #1 thing people recommend when gap coverage comes up, COBRA is not an option.

Thank you!"

We are BLM land campers, as we have four dogs, and like to not have neighbors, not wake up to other people, and even see the milky way every once in awhile... But we have been staying in RV parks because the MiFi we bought from Verizon is useless. 20 gb of unthrottled data and then the ""throttled"" data isn't worth anything. Google's doodle won't even load. Here's the thing, we weren't streaming, we weren't downloading stuff for fun, we were working. 

After hours on the phone here and there with Verizon, being sold boosts, being told those weren't real, and finally sitting on the phone for somewhere around there hours yesterday to get the real scoop that the boosts were real but still throttled data, we have finally figured out that the MiFi isn't for us. But the rub is that we need internet. Period. 

We have researched satellite and real satellite is like 15k. We are unable and unwilling to spend that. So fine, we can't plant ourselves in the middle of nowhere for two weeks like we had envisioned, but at least the opportunity to wake up somewhere beautiful rather than staring at our neighbors trailer. 

What is your internet solution? Are you tethered to a contract? Do you have service in place where other people are frustratedly looking at their phones (i.e. USA National Parks)?

EDIT:  Upon further scrutiny and research it seems that maintaining permanent residence in Panama is easy as visiting every two years, however being a permanent resident of Panama doesn't automatically give you tax residency status.

Yesterday I heard machine guns right outside my door on Independencia. Criminals were shooting up the street and two police officers got killed a few houses down from my Airbnb. It was unnerving, to say the least, to hear machine guns going off that close! The 28th of May, another man got shot on the same street. 

On July 8, several people got shot in Conspiración Boulevard. Three people died including a young teenage girl who was just eating at a taco stand. More people got injured. At the beginning of June, a woman was shooting on the famous Aldama street in the middle of the day. That's right in the downtown tourist area.

There are other types of violence going on as well. A  woman (tourist) recently got assaulted and raped when she took a taxi on her own during the day. He punched her in the temple so she passed out, then he raped her. Last week, there was a mugging during the day in the middle of downtown. The mugger held a knife and threatened to stab two women in the stomach.

chiuah,1xesryrm,A frivolous commentary on DN Life: So many mediocre coffees,"There are certain aspects of life in which I am quite free-and-easy with my money. One of those is coffee, as for the equivalent of US$1-5, I can wander into a local cafe, sample their beverages, and enjoy some local color. I enjoy the social and experiential aspect of it, and I disagree with the apparent ""war on (cafe) coffee"" waged by financial gurus. 

&#x200B;

This DN stint isn't my first iteration of life abroad, but the last 15 months have taken me around East and Southeast Asia in addition to Australia and NZ. 

&#x200B;

Currently, I am in Langkawi (strongly recommended - amazing Arabic/Syrian food scene in addition to Malaysian/seafood). 

&#x200B;

 It dawned on me today just *how much mediocre coffee* I have subjected myself to.  Of the various shops I have wandered into over the past week, the best one I had was an americano @ a French-owned creperie/cafe Breizh Up.  Upon paying my bill, I saw that they used a *nespresso machine*.  They charged market rate for a barista coffee (MYR $10-14). 

&#x200B;

Yesterday's Americano was rather insipid in flavor with an abundance of grounds.  11 ringgit wasted.   I assume that in these scenarios that it's a confluence of mediocrity: lousy beans, untrained barista, and machinery that isn't Italian top-of-the-line. 

&#x200B;

I don't expect a lovingly made brew (a la a fashionable Milanese cafe) all the time, but it dawned on me just how bad the success rate is.  I finally said, ""fuck it"" and decamped to Starbucks for what I knew would be a passable brewed coffee. Corporate mega-consistency has its perks.

&#x200B;

Places with good coffee: **Hong Kong**, if you were willing to part with no less than HK$35.  Surprisingly yet unsurprisingly, **Bali**. I suppose the brigades of holidaying Aussies (and no small number of working retirees opening up Aussie-style cafes) ""force"" a reasonably high standard of coffee."

I don't mind paying applicable personal income taxes wherever I'm a resident, but I'd like to avoid excessive additional corporate taxes and high running costs if possible - I'm a one-person full-time contractor producing a single invoice per month, in a very stable work situation.

The catch is that my contract with my client requires me to have professional indemnity insurance.

I'm aware that one option would be to find a Singaporean company willing to sponsor me, but I'm also considering trying to find remote work. However, the issue with this is I wouldn't have a visa and as far as I understand you can't get a Singaporean work visa unless the company is based locally. So, I'm sort of unsure how viable of an option this would be. If anyone has any insight or advice regarding this situation I would greatly appreciate it!"
ckloq2,2bljs9z,Brexit escape to Portugal,"Hi everyone. As the title suggests, I’m a Brit looking to get away from the madness of Brexit. I’ve considered a number of European countries but Portugal is coming up top.

My plan would be to move there before October 31 and establish residency. I know I can be in country for three months before having to do this, but I would like to do it early in case of a no deal Brexit. Is this possible? And if so, what do I need in order to achieve it?

Regarding my employment situation, I work remotely in data science, with clients from the UK and US. I bill them via a UK limited company of which I am the sole director. I pay myself in a combination of salary and dividends. I’m also a full-time PhD candidate at a UK university (and can do my research remotely).

I would aim to continue both these activities from Portugal. So my main question is, can I become registered as a resident in Portugal ahead of Brexit, while continuing to pay tax to the UK? Are there any pitfalls or other things I should be aware of?

Thanks in advance for any advice!"

cl6x27,plxsq,"How to Pick a Primary Country for Expat Insurance, if you're a Digital Nomad?","I am looking into long term insurance options abroad (I've been a nomad for a year, and expected at least 1 more year), but all policies require you to set a primary residence country (outside your nationality, in my case which is US). 

As a nomad, I stay most places just one month at a time on tourist visa. Would a tourist visa disqualify a place as a residence country? If not, do I pick a country at random that I'm going to on my insurance application?

I am looking at plans that cover 3-6 months of US coverage. It's just fuzzy on how important the primary country is, and want to make sure I will be covered in all countries I visit.

I'm healthy so this is really for major emergencies only, and I don't want any discrepancy/confusion over ""primary country"" residency to disqualify any claims.

Any experience with this?"
clmec7,1ysbdom9,"Any idea what ""Private room in guesthouse"" should mean on AirBnB? Or what the word ""guesthouse"" implies in general? Specifically vis-à-vis laptop work","I'm asking because I'm staying in a ""private room in guesthouse"" that has turned out to what I would call a private room in person's private house. In particular, the host just told me ""I don't allow guests to turn the sitting room into a home office, this is for socializing, this is a place for tourists"", although the house rules only say ""Guests are welcome to use common areas and keep clean during/after use"" so I'm clearly not breaking any (and, as you'd expect, there's nothing about ""tourists"" specifically in the description). By the way, my ""home office"" consists of one 13-inch laptop, a cord, and a glass of water.


Because of this rule and the guesthouse category, I had not made specific queries in advance about whether I could work in the common spaces, though I did ask about wifi and say I needed it because I would be working some of the time. For a ""room in a private house,"" I definitely would have asked in advance if it would create conflict.


In general, this turn out to be a place with only two guest rooms, and the other is empty, so it feels very much like I'm a roommate in this woman's house. She is retired, so always around. In general she treats it very much like her house. I've been trying to treat it as such too (being very careful about cleaning up etc). 


I'm less annoyed about being confined to my room than being misled and made to feel I was doing something wrong. Should I have seen this coming? In future, I'll probably err on the side of caution for anything outside the ""Entire place"" category."

I'm a US citizen, been working remotely abroad for 3 years, claiming FEIE every year. I am realizing now that FEIE may not be the most optimal way to go, when compared with the tax advantages of retirement savings accounts, which I can not contribute to since after FEIE my taxable income is reduced to $0.  


[https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-ira-contribution-limits](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-ira-contribution-limits)  
\^\^ Here is the IRS website stating that maximum contribution is the lesser of X dollars OR taxable income if taxable income < X dollars. This link is for an IRA, but the same applies for Roth IRA, Simple 401k and SEP IRA, etc...  


My question is this: would it be legal to simply reduce the income I claim for FEIE, so that my total taxable income will be exactly equal to the maximum contribution to the Roth IRA (or SEP IRA)? That would offer the best of both worlds: no income tax on income funneled into normal taxable accounts, only paying income tax on money that funnels into tax-advantaged Roth IRA.  


Hypothetical example: Total income = $60,000. Claim only $54,000 as foreign earned. Contribute $6000 to a Roth IRA.

I do freelancing and other digital business such as a small sass i own. Im young so i expect to live the forward 5 years for sure. My question is, because im having trouble leaving paypal (the freelance and the digital business all deposit in paypal my earnings), what is the best ""money circuit"" to enjoy more services and have more financial abilities ? I was looking into some possibilities:

\-One possible idea is to buy bitcoin with paypal and from there deposit in neteller or skrill, or transferwise or use an exchange. Payoneer puts as an imperative condition to have a bank account (thats why i dont add it to the list).

\-My other alternative is to buy bitcoin and live with btc, but it is more challenging to buy things because most times i have to use local bitcoin to get cash or buy gift cards. And the btc isnt the most stable thing in the world to hold money. (i would keep paypal for airbnb and another online services that accept it).

\-other alternatives is what im looking for, or some advice, recomendation, about the posted methods. I find it really hard only using paypal, so... any suggestions, life examples are welcomed.

coxczs,3z75e9lp,Here are some niche job boards digital nomads might find useful,"Hello! I've created a list of niche job boards that digital nomads might find useful. I've divided this post into two: niche job boards according to **(1) expertise** and **(2) industry**.

The jobs posted on these boards are not exclusively remote, but these are job boards that frequently post openings for remote work, so there's absolutely no shortage of openings here suitable for the digital nomad. I have not personally vetted these job boards, but they appear to be frequently used by reputable companies. If you have used any of the job boards here and had a good experience, let everyone know in the comments below. If you have used any of the job boards here and had a bad experience, comment down below as well so I can edit this post. If you have suggestions for niche job boards, let me know too so I can add it to the list.

* **Expertise**

[Job board for Front-end developers](https://css-tricks.com/jobs/) \- this job board has no shortage of work for CSS masters. They frequently post remote work.

[Job board for Ruby on Rails programmers](https://www.rorjobs.com/) \- excellent resource for Ruby on Rails-focused work. Frequent poster of remote work too.

[Job board for Python programmers](https://www.remotepython.com/) \- this specific job board for Python masters only show REMOTE work. Go nuts!

[Job board for JavaScript programmers](https://jsremotely.com/) \- this one's PURELY remote too. JavaScript peeps yearning the nomad life should definitely check this one out.

[Job board for writers and editors](https://problogger.com/jobs/) \- half of the postings here are remote, and the work ranges from blog writing, to editing, to ghostwriting, etc.

[Job board for writers and editors (part 2)](https://www.bloggingpro.com/jobs/) \- this one doesn't post as frequently as the one above, but there's quite a number of remote work too, and major companies like Bustle seem to post here frequently.

[Job board for online teaching](https://www.teachaway.com/online-teaching-jobs) \- everything online, so digital nomad-ucators will definitely find something here. Downside -- most postings are for English teachers, a few for other subjects.

[Job board for translation work](https://www.proz.com/language-jobs) \- if you are fluent in two or more languages, this might be the perfect job board for you. A [translator](https://whereintheworldisnina.com/how-to-be-a-translator/) who works remotely has personally recommended this job board.

* **Industry**

[Job board for edtech](https://www.edsurge.com/jobs) \- professionals who want to join edtech would surely love this one. Remote work gets posted here too.

[Job board for fintech](https://fintechfans.com/jobs/) \- this one's a dedicated job board for fintech.

[Job board for crypto](https://cryptocurrencyjobs.co/) \- another dedicated job board, this one's for cryptocurrency. Half of the jobs here are remote.

[Job board for healthtech](https://rockhealth.com/job-board/) \- this website, while not a dedicated job board, posts openings from the healthtech sector. Remote jobs are available too.

[Job board for sextech](https://xxxstartups.com/) \- this is an upcoming job board for sextech startups, which include sex toy manufacturing, birth control, sex education, etc. *Disclaimer: I'm the developer of this platform*.

[Job board for non-profits](https://nonprofitremote.com/) \- this one's cool because it's a job board for non-profits dedicated to remote positions."

-cheap (no more than 800 USD for rent)/good internet 

-bustling with lots of energy, cafe culture, lively, great food

-historical/cultural sites are a must: museums, ruins, castles, temples, etc

-have some element of nature, be it mountains, sea side, forest, etc nearby 

Cooler weather is a bonus but not necessary! 

As much as I liked Bali, I hated Ubud city center because it just felt like an outdoor shopping mall, I really don't want something like that. Instead I'm looking for a place I can keep exploring slowly over a period of a few months and still be enthralled by it. 

I have been looking into Albania and Georgia since US citizens can stay there for about a year, but I'm also considering Turkey (I loved Istanbul), Romania and Armenia.

Yet I thought, how can we afford this? What if we, digital nomads, could travel & live together in small groups all over the world for cheaper then the usual rent? To live among other inspiring like-minded people? To empower each other? To share great moments?  


This is just one place I found within 15 minutes, for +-300eu/month each with 3 persons: [https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/plus/4127716?location=Europe&toddlers=0&adults=5&check\_in=2019-10-01&check\_out=2019-10-31&source\_impression\_id=p3\_1566316673\_JszKAoJwM%2Fq1NX9H&s=MPXwZnXQ](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/plus/4127716?location=Europe&toddlers=0&adults=5&check_in=2019-10-01&check_out=2019-10-31&source_impression_id=p3_1566316673_JszKAoJwM%2Fq1NX9H&s=MPXwZnXQ)

ct2mos,,Taking a leap of faith (stretching 12k over 11 months),"So by February of 2020 I'll have 15k saved up. My plan is to spend February through May in Mexico. This whole time I will be focusing on a few websites I'd like to build, learning Spanish, and surfing. And I'll do a little exploring on the weekends. From May to November I want to be in SE Asia (Bali and Thailand most likely). Here I'll be continuing web development, learning a new language and surfing. And of course some exploring when time permits.

I'll probably spend December with my parents back in the US. 

I think airfare and other travel expenses will cost me around 3k total if I buy now so that leaves me with 12k to stretch over 11 months. I would prefer to stay in the same location as long as possible as to limit traveling expenses and keep my focus on web development. My hope is that by the end of 2020 I will have built an online presence that will allow me to sustain this lifestyle. Or maybe I will have developed either my coding or graphic design skills enough to land a remote job and continue traveling. At the very least hopefully I will have enough skills to get a job back in the US and return to the rat race. 

If not I will have no savings at 27 years old, but I'm sure the experience will have been worth it. I have a serving job here in the US that I can always return to that will at least pay the bills to live a meager existence here. 

What are your thoughts? Any advice?"

Second: how viable is doing this with a teenager in tow? We've already got her in independent study, so the schooling wouldn't really be an issue, but she's kind of addicted to technology (I say, as I'm constantly browsing Reddit...) and I'm not sure if she'd feel isolated. 

My girlfriend wants to quit her job, and is weighing options of travelling for awhile or moving to a new state. I'd prefer this route, and I'm trying to tempt her with sea turtles in Bali, but I do worry about the kid not being up to it. She says she's for it, but I don't think she understands what a life without YouTube is like.

I'm also a little worried about safety, specifically the teenager's, but I don't know how unfounded that is. It's probably mostly from a lack of experience."

cwt0qr,vim4f,How I met my wife and why I decided to build yet another flight price tracker that has saved me thousands of $$$ over the years.,"Hello world,

I've been working on [TripFate](https://tripfate.com/), and thought it might be a good idea to share the story and motivation behind it.

So I met my wife exactly 4 years ago - all thanks to being on the right flight at the right time. Funny thing is, I wasn't really supposed to be on that flight to Rome. As much as I loved traveling, I was a poor college student and I couldn't really afford the expensive flights.

And then it happened. I was looking for flights to random destinations after wrapping up my project report at 4 AM, and I found a **round-trip ticket to Rome (from NYC) for \~$110**! It was crazy because the usual prices are at least in the $350-400 range (if you're lucky).

I got super hooked! After I returned from my trip, I registered on a bunch of websites to get alerts if there was a price drop. I did get some good deals, but nothing was as crazy cheap as the one I had found for my trip to Rome.

I continued to manually find flights to 'random' destinations on Google flights and other websites, but it was a painful process. Plus, there was no way I could keep an eye on all these flight trackers 24x7 and create alerts for all the places that I really didn't know existed, but are AMAZING for travelers!

Being a student of Computer Science, I figured there must be some way for me to automate my process of looking through multiple travel sites for amazing deals to random destinations I wanted to travel.

So that's what I did. I created a service for myself that'd look for flights from across the internet that really were 'great' for their price. In the beginning, it simply sent API requests and had a bunch of if-else statements. However, over the years, I've added a bunch of Machine Learning and Deep Learning tricks to the algorithm.

Moreover, I have instances of my 'smart travel finder' running on around 14 different servers around the world (who knew looking for a flight from India is cheaper sometimes!).

I started getting lots of really interesting flights: **\~$170 round-trip to Cancun, \~$230 to Paris, \~$340 to India**... and so I decided to share it with family and friends and friends of friends. Once the list grew to over 200, I thought maybe people would be interested in paying for the service, and that's how [TripFate](https://tripfate.com/) was born.

TripFate is currently in Beta - I really want to make sure people find it useful before I flip the switch and charge $24.99/year for the premium plan to cover the costs of the servers and allow me and my wife to dedicate more time for further development and support. If you'd like to try it, please register on [https://TripFate.com](http://tripfate.com/). I'd really appreciate any feedback!

I feel like when you're living a life that many people would be envious of - being able to travel on a whim, work remotely, and live in relative luxury, it would make it more difficult to connect with people who don't have those opportunities. Maybe it's not an issue.

First, thanks for taking the time to see this post, as it's a long one. But hopefully this post can give a quarter of the value I take from it, even if that just means easing the worries of someone else here on /r/digitalnomad.  I finished a degree in physics (second major in classics) from a state school this June. I did well and I genuinely enjoyed my undergraduate experience, or I should say, I enjoy the fact that I feel like a well-rounded, capable individual upon leaving.

However, I went into school for better or worse with a ""liberal arts"" mindset. I told myself that the point of my college experience was to become a well-rounded thinker, who can work with words and numbers, and who can think clearly. In other words, I put next to no thought in my career prospects post graduation, aside from thinking that I might go to grad school. I regret this, and if I could go back in time, I would've thought more about life after school.

I've been looking for (exclusively remote) work since about April, and I'm discovering that while I do believe I accomplished my goal of being well-rounded, I'm not very skilled. I could tell you the viscosity of some unknown liquid and work in Dirac notation, but, my undergrad experience lacked hard career skills, having me take one single programming class (Intro to C++). I've gotten far (final two candidates) in some jobs in remote data entry & analysis, but no cigar. On top of this, I've recently gotten interested in the power of software development and the IT field in general.

Anyways, I'm now adopting the mindset that I'm willing to put the work in to become skilled. I've seen a ton of remote work available in the IT field, no surprise. My question is for any IT digital nomads: what language/set of tools/system(s) would you recommend to someone looking for remote IT work? I will continue to scour the internet, but, I am so unsure what languages are on their way out, which ones are on the rise, and which ones have a good shelf life. Obviously no one wants to waste time, and I'd hate to jump into something that bears no fruits. Finally, as far as my interests, I like technical stuff, but, I really value the ability to work remotely far more than I value doing precisely what I love. In other words, I'm happy to work hard on a project I'm less than passionately interested in if it affords me a work-life balance. I don't put almost any value on working for a brand name. I just don't have much an idea where to start, but I can promise that I've learned how to learn.

Any insights are deeply appreciated. Thanks again for your time.

I find this isn't very conducive to work. What I am really looking for right now is somewhere where I can do what Cal Newport describes as **deep work**.

So what I am asking is for a typical digital nomad location that has this kind of peaceful and remote feel to it. Good public transport and infrastructure is useful, and the cost of living being cheap would be ideal.

**A little about me**

32yo Australian. Been overseas now for about seven months. Spent one month in Phuket, two months in KL, one month in Kuching, and am about to finish my third and final month in Saigon. My onward ticket from Thailand is back to Vietnam (Hanoi) but whether or not I use that ticket remains to be seen. I'm basically making plans as I go. I never even intended to come to Vietnam and yet Saigon has been my favourite place so far. 

I make my money (not much but enough) running a subscription website focused on a very niche field, and generally work out of cafes.

d24rf7,rgonfuk,Opinions on staying long-term in Taiwan/Taipei ?,"So, earlier this year I embarked on a trip to scout a few dozens countries/cities in America and Asia where I might want to say in the long term.

I saw a lot of interesting places, but up until I reached Taipei nothing really made me feel like I would like to actually live there for 3-6 months.

After a few days in Taipei I feel like I'm really in love with the city:

* t's relatively cheap in terms of food, housing and transport
* The internet is great, the food is amazing and diverse
* The food is amazing and there's tons of variety
* The people seem foreigner friendly, easy to find locals to hang out with
* The nature around the island is breathtaking
* The city is easy to navigate and beautiful in so many ways
* It seems very safe overall (e.g. getting pick-pocketed might be a thing but I doubt anyone would try mugging you)
* There's no visa issues, at least not for my nationality, they pretty much let you stay hassle free for 90days a year

The only real issue I see with it is the weather during certain days/seasons and the insects + diseases, but that seems to be an issue in all of SEA.

So, in light of this, I thought I'd get opinions from some of you guys regarding Taiwan/Taipei, did any of you live&work there for a longer time ? How did you like it ? What are the upside/downsides ?"

I've got the stand, now I just need a keyboard. Weight and size are **very** important as I'd like to keep my bag under 7kg, and it's already a bit hard to close. I do some programming.

Some options I've looked at:

|Keyboard|Weight (g)|Width (cm)|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|MS Universal Foldable Keyboard | 179| 29.5|Seems to get some love from here, but super expensive|
|Logitech Keys-to-go|182|24.2|Compact (good and bad), still expensive. Slides around desk?|
| Apple Magic Keyboard |231|27.9|Seems impossibly light, hassle to get it working well with Windows|
| iClever tri-fold|280|27.7|Mentioned on r/dn, but decent number of 1-start reviews on amazon|
|Logitech k380|423|27.9|Looks like a great affordable choice, but weighs 1/3 of my whole laptop|

I actually ordered and returned the k380 (Spanish layout... oops), and while it looked like a great keyboard, it's really heavy.

Really looking for any first-hand experience with these options or other recommendations. Thanks in advance"
d2p61z,2rzwdbeb,My experience with SafetyWing,"Guys,

Sharing this little report here (and also here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/safetywing/comments/d2p187/my\_experience\_with\_safetywing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/safetywing/comments/d2p187/my_experience_with_safetywing/)), maybe it will be useful for those who are thinking about getting a SafetyWing insurance. I am traveling since February19. We started in Mozambique, spent a few months in Serbia, and right now we are in France.

When I was in Serbia I had to go to a dermatologist, since a small black point appeared on my toe. I managed to find a good one, who speaks english, he charged me 50 USD for the appointment. After a few days, we realized that was a footbug (pretty common in Africa). I was bitten by this footbug. Nothing serious, solved in a few days. Obviously it was not a pre-existing condition. After filling in a long (really long) form (very burocratic, a lot of emails, different information being provided by different people, a total mess), I managed to open my claim through Tokio Marine (SafetyWing is just dealer, all the insurance stuff is provided by Tokio Marine).

30 days after I got this response:

*This claim has been denied due to skin exclusion.  The EOB has not been generated yet but you should receive shortly.  You can also check the status of your claim on client zone*

*Acne, moles, skin tags, diseases of sebaceous glands, seborrhea, sebaceous cyst, hypertrophic and atrophic conditions of skin, nevus*

This is really, really frustrating. My case does not fit in any of these conditions that the person lazily pasted on the email. I was bitten by a bug. It was not a pre-existing condition (neither it is a disease). I know that it is not much money (it is 50 bucks), but it is really important so I can feel safe that I am dealing with a company that can provide me support if any major issue happen.

Now I can ""appeal"", but the Tokio Marine website is really, really messy, it takes almost a week for them to answer one email and it is not clear where (or what) I should register all the ""new"" information (which is not new, since all the needed information was on the original claim).

It looks that SafetyWing is just a colourful skin that was applied on the really inefficient insurance provider."
d2urhf,k8xxb,Remember “I make $300K a year as a copywriter”? I did what the post said and just signed my first $10K project. Zero prior copywriting experience. One month from planning to signing. Documented entire journey on YouTube.,"Proof -- [imgur](https://imgur.com/a/3kDo465)

Hey guys -- long-time lurker first-time poster.

I always wanted to start a side business and finally got to it after finding the now-infamous series of posts from a guy making 6-figures in direct-response copywriting.

Quick background -- this past winter I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/8lhofp/i_make_about_10000_a_month_as_a_copywriter_proof/) claiming to be making $10K a month by writing online ads, as well as [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/92a7rd/i_decided_i_wanted_to_make_about_30000_between/) claiming to had made $30K doing exactly same thing.

For a bunch of reasons I got super excited about the whole thing and felt like I had to try it. I remember I lost my sleep the night I found those -- I clicked on every link in the comments and googled every mentioned name, course, book, concept, etc. This was all the way back to around December/January of 2019.

Fast-forward to the end of July -- I still haven’t done anything aside from getting excited about the idea mainly due to the demands of my day job and feeling burnt-out in general. This all however started to change when I figured I could start a YouTube channel to document my journey in copywriting.

I was thinking about starting an educational channel for sometime then, but couldn’t decide on the exact content. At first I was thinking to make videos about how I went from washing dishes full-time in 2013 to building a decent career in finance. But the idea of building the content around my past didn’t feel that fun to me and this is where the copywriting came in handy -- I figured, why don’t I start a side-business and document it as I go? This should be more dynamic and fun -- and the accounts will be much more accurate compared to what now essentially are just fragments of my memory of how things have gone in the past.

So anyways -- the YouTube idea gave me a much needed boost in energy and I got to work.

My background has to do with investing so I decided to focus on the financial niche. I’ve put together a quick plan based on the two posts I’ve mentioned earlier: (1) opt-in and study every financial sales-letter I can find by clicking ads, (2) write a mock-up financial copy that I could use to promote myself to publishers, (3) build a list of publishers and connect with them on LinkedIn, and (4) reach out to publishers and see who might be interested in doing some projects together.

After I made my first video I came back to Reddit and found the “$300K posts” on r/Entrepreneur and r/digitalnomad  \-- and those came super handy as they had much more details than the first two posts, but the overall idea is all the same -- by the way, not that it’s not obvious already, but all these posts were made by the same person.

*(there is actually one more relevant post from the same person that has to do with the technical aspect of copywriting, it’s useful -- here it is --* [*link*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/90fovr/tell_more_to_sell_more_why_longer_sales_pitches/)*.)*

Anyways -- I did exactly as the posts advised and just signed my very first sales-letter project that pays $10K (+ one year commission). (it also actually ended-up being $7.5K due to a 25% discount I offered since this is our first project together and I got nothing real in my portfolio). Overall it took me about a month to go from the initial planning to signing.

Now -- one thing worth clarifying is that while I did have zero copywriting experience, I had plenty of experiences that are quite relevant to this -- research, pitching stock ideas, general salesmanship, online marketing, and etc. -- so while this is a new niche for me -- I had a lot of stuff going that I could leverage here.

So -- all this is not to say that it would be reasonable to expect everyone to have the same results under the same timeline (or any positive results at all for that matter). ***But one thing is for sure -- the guy who wrote the posts I’ve mentioned is legit and gave out incredibly valuable information for free.*** So if copywriting is something that you can see yourself doing -- congrats, because you have a free access to information that would cost $3-$5K on the market if packaged as a course.

Now -- most importantly -- none of this has anything to do with “get rich quick” -- while I did go from nothing to making money in a short period of time in this specific instance -- this was only possible because I did a lot of useful work during the last 6 years since I graduated from university. I washed dishes, sold apparel, did a number of unpaid work, contract work, did every piece of work very well even if it was outside of my job description, and a ton of other more marketing/investing related stuff. This copywriting situation is just where all that random work came together and allowed me to do well.

In fact -- one of my main goals for the channel is to show that not everyone gets rich fast -- sometimes you do stuff that might not make much sense to you at the time but it can lead to some interesting places down the road -- places you are not even aware of right now but that are actually the very best for you in the long-term. So don’t give-up and just do your part -- things will work out -- making money is not the hardest thing under the sun so try not to stress out too much -- it might just take a bit of time.

Anyways -- here is a link to the [latest video](https://youtu.be/hTgxK8C8oXg) and feel free to ask questions here -- I will try to answer as much as I can.

*(just to clarify -- I’ve been documenting on YT since early August from the very beginning -- so there are 5 videos in total as of this week)*

Good luck everyone!

tl;dr -- basically title.

P.S. -- I don’t know the author of the original posts personally and he is not paying me in any way. In fact, I’m the one trying to get him to take my money in exchange for help with my writing (through an email he provided in his last video). I also signed-up for his slack group but it’s not live yet (as far as I know).

P.P.S -- If you’re a proven direct-response financial copywriter who is down to help out a less experienced guy -- let’s connect please -- I would be happy to work with someone to improve my copy.

Edit 1: this job is called ""**DIRECT-RESPONSE** copywriting"" -- where a publisher would hire a copywriter to write 40-60 page letter selling some products online (financial newsletters in this case). The reason I am not going into details is because the reddit posts I've mentioned here already explained that -- this is kinda of a continuation of those posts.

Edit 2: if you're looking for a detailed information on how to do this then I suggest you focus on 8 videos from the $300K post. This post and the YT videos are more of a documentary/personal account of how it worked in my case. I did add as many details as I could but I felt like the 8 videos already got that covered, and way better than I could have done.

Edit 3: just to help you get a quick idea whether this is something that might be interesting to you as a job -- the core activities are: doing product and industry research (to understand what you are selling), crafting a sales pitch (taking your research and trying to come up with a unique sales angle), and writing 40-60 page sales-letters to sell the product (presenting the sales-angle and proving it through technical details among other things). Ideally you would also have some kinda industry background in the niche you're writing for -- like, if you're selling golf equipment it's better if you know a lot about golf going into it -- but this is not a must-have since you can learn on the job.

d3c6hk,2ut5uuw3,Is health insurance necessary for a perpetual traveler?,"My health insurance plan is coming up for renewal. The reason I got it was because I needed it for a visa, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered because I don't usually travel with insurance. I started actually reading through the policy and I've now realized that it's a complete waste of money for my situation. They won't actually cover me in the case of a medical emergency.

I've been reading through some other policies and the amount of exceptions are crazy. SafetyWing is commonly recommended and they've recently updated their policy to be more robust; previously their policy provided very poor coverage. Their max payout is $250k, which I've heard some people claim is too low, but to me it seems more than adequate enough.

I've heard about the horror stories of $100k medical bills in Thailand. It's hard for me to understand how such a bill could be possible in a country like Thailand. In the USA, sure. But in Thailand? What could possibly cost that much?

I pay for all my medical expenses out of pocket because and take advantage of medical tourism. I'm only concerned about emergency cover.

Instead of horror stories, I'd be interested to hear some success stories. I've read lots of cases of insurance not paying out as people expected. And looking through policies it's clear that most insurance providers have plenty of ways to not be responsible for covering expenses. I want to be sure that insurance is actually going to cover me in the case of an emergency, since a lot of these products have too many loopholes to be of any value.

An issue with a lot of insurances is that they assume a home country or a permanent residence. This is one benefit of SafetyWing. Although they do require you to have a ""home country"" they don't seem to be very strict about it. They are very young though so I don't know if they'll actually provide coverage if the time comes.

Does anybody else self insure? Or what is your strategy for health insurance when you don't have a permanent home?"

My schengen visa expired about 3 months ago as I spent three months in Europe, so as it's  basically about to renew itself, I was wondering if I could go to somewhere to study AND continue working. I would particularly love to study German (as I'm intermediate in it, but would love to learn it fluently) or any other language. My girlfriend at the moment does not have a remote gig, but loved the idea of going somewhere to study whatever she wanted, too.

We looked up some language programs online but they last about as long as the visa - and I was wondering if there's a way to enroll in a university and be registered as a student, so we could stay for longer than the 3 months, and she could also quite possibly get a part-time job?

I would obviously have to continue my remote gig - but that's fine.

All information I´ve found on this topic is how ridiculously hard it is or how it's only really doable through scholarships, and it's not something I woud be able to apply to.

Would appreciate whatever information anyone can provide :)

d47bua,wp2zh,Traveling Around Central/South America in a Jeep,"*TL;DR: Looking to get tips or insight from the group on traveling around South America (via a Jeep) for a long period of time as a full-time remote software developer*

I'm currently a ""digital nomad"" in that I work remotely as a data engineer for a company based in the US. I moved to Mexico City a few months ago and will be here until August 2020, upon which my girlfriend and I will travel from southern Mexico throughout South America for an undetermined amount of time (likely a year or more).

We will be traveling around with a dog (all vaccines will be kept up-to-date) in a 4-door Jeep Wrangler, but we plan to stay at places long enough so that we don't get burned out from traveling all the time. Additional information that may help provide context:

* Jeep Wrangler has a Mexican license plate (not sure if that makes a difference). I will try to get the best car insurance out there but I know it will not cover all countries in South America. It's also a new-ish Jeep (low miles).
* I have a Google Fi phone (Pixel 3), which I believe has the dual SIM functionality
* Girlfriend is fluent in Spanish (born and raised in Mexico City)
* Dog is very acclimated to traveling (i.e. doesn't get carsick)
* I **love** driving so I can do it for long periods at at time, if needed (will avoid night driving though)
* I have a Charles Schwab banking account and credit cards with zero international transaction fees
* I get paid very well so it'd be easy for me to build up a separate ""emergency fund"" for this trip
* I can request for time off two-weeks in advance in case if the drive to the next destination will take longer than a weekend

Given the above information, I'm hoping to get thoughts on the concerns or questions that I have about this long-term trip:

* Wifi reliability - All of my coworkers work remotely so we use Zoom/Slack for video calls. Essentially, I need to be online the entire time I work.  I plan to stay at Airbnbs that have wifi, so I suppose bringing my own Wifi router may help alleviate concerns about weak wifi signals?
* IT security: the IT folks at work raised security concerns about me working remotely out of Mexico (we're a healthcare company). What techniques/methods can I implement to alleviate their concerns about me working remotely in various countries for a long period of time? I never use unencrypted public wifi for work, if that helps.
* What places are must-sees? Any hidden gems or underrated places to check out?
* What places should be avoided? This can be due to low wifi reliability, safety, or just general overrated-ness.
* Is it difficult obtaining visas as an American outside of the US? For example, if we're in Peru and we want to go to Bolivia, is it difficult for me to obtain a visa while in Peru?
* What car maintenance skills should we learn in advance? I've been lucky in that I've never had car issues my entire life (no flat tires, ) so I'm hoping to learn some things before the trek.
* Any other thoughts? Are we crazy?"

[VRBO listings let owners add specifics to amenities](https://preview.redd.it/tv38yllqsvn31.png?width=861&format=png&auto=webp&s=3315cc19fa5c7e503d5605b24428da1bd3fe5a0c)

EDIT: I've been comparing VRBO vs. Airbnb. Out of \~30 listings I've seen so far,

* all used great English. On Airbnb, you get a mishmash of good English, crappy English and whatever the local language is, with the latter hosts showing they don't care for international travelers.
* all had **good** photos. Many Airbnb unit photos are dark and lousy, and completely miss parts of the property (e.g. 2BD place only shows 1 bedroom).
* most had reviews more detailed than the ""great place will come again thank u"" stuff on Airbnb
* about 10% of VRBO listings had 3D/virtual tours of the unit

VRBO features that Airbnb doesn't have:

* You can sort listings by price. [Airbnb has removed sorting long ago](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Airbnb-remove-its-sort-by-price-feature) and refused to enable any kinds of sorting (see [https://community.withairbnb.com/t5/Hosting/Sorting-listing-by-price/td-p/559404](https://community.withairbnb.com/t5/Hosting/Sorting-listing-by-price/td-p/559404)).

Airbnb is better at:

* You can **filter by ""Laptop-friendly workspace""**. Very useful for DNs, and HomeAway doesn't have that filter.
* Showing the total price along with the per-night price.
* Much larger selection of properties, and somewhat lower prices.

The comparison was done for the same class of rentals - 2BD/2BA places in Mexico's Riviera Maya.

Guess Airbnb has fallen victim to its own popularity. VRBO only has 3 (three) posts in /r/digitalnomad, despite the company being founded [more than a decade before Airbnb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vrbo). Yay marketing!

So I'm about to book via VRBO. Has anyone booked with them already and had issues with the property/host? How helpful was VRBO?

**UPDATE & TL;DR**: we booked with VRBO/HomeAway and had no problems. The apartment was as described, management was super helpful, as well as the front staff. However, these are not exactly attributes of the website. HomeAway's advantage is that it has a more refined selection of properties, for the choosy traveler, before everyone and their dog got on Airbnb. The only minus in that regard is that they don't have a filter for ""Laptop-friendly workspace"".

Both sites suck at keyword search. Despite [repeated requests](https://community.withairbnb.com/t5/Hosting/Waterfront-property-search-how-can-I-search-for-a-waterfront/m-p/84016) from the community, Airbnb doesn't let you search for keywords, e.g. ""top floor"". Instead, you have ridiculous filters like ""shampoo""."

d7fup8,11p15f8v,My version of DN so far,"I have an educational (not travel related) website and youtube channel that I earn passive income from Adsense, Patreon, Amazon Affiliate, etc. I typically do big batches of work, like a full-time month of content creation then schedule it to be published regularly, while I do other things. 

I went to SEA last year for 7 months. 6 were mostly motorbike trip / hostel backpacking, and 1 was focussed work from an apartment in Hanoi. I came back to my home country (Canada) for the last 4 months where I picked up an out-of-town construction job, working 12-14 hour days, and had per diems and accommodations covered. I got some of my digital work done when I wasn't too tired from the labour. Construction is done now, so next week I'm heading to South Africa, where I plan to buy another motorbike, and then tour the southern third of the continent for at least 6 months. Most of the time will be spent living as a motorbike tourer - camping, hosteling, getting stuck in the mud, and will hopefully try to get some batches of work done so my future passive income continues to grow. 

Anyhow, I'm excited that the next leg of my journey is coming up, and felt like sharing my version of this widely ranging lifestyle."
d7mpd4,znekoox,Anyone Have Experience In Dubai?,"My wife and I have been doing the DN thing for the past two years or so, just booked our first housesit in Dubai. However, I'm a bit nervous about spending a month there, for a few reasons:

1. We're American -- I'm sure I don't need to point this out, but we don't exactly have the best relationship with many ME countries. I know Dubai has a large expat community and is generally welcoming to tourists, but with Trump ramping things up again, it could be an issue.
2. I'm an atheist -- I'm not dumb enough to engage locals on the topic, but it says Atheist on my facebook account, and I've written publicly about the topic in the past. Are the authorities going to investigate/care? 
3. I write about marijuana -- One of my writing projects is to translate scientific research regarding marijuana to publicize both its benefits and harms. While I'm not a smoker myself and have no intent to bring any with me, Dubai's anti-drug laws are notoriously harsh.

What I'm looking for is some advice from people who've spent quite a bit of time in the city/UAE. Everything I've read online says it's not the people you need to be careful of, it's the government, so I'm really curious what it's like to live under that sort of rule and what experiences you've had. Thanks!"

d8j4kj,hh7zl,Digital Nomad Taxation AMA,"I have been away from this sub for a long time. Good to see it's still going strong! I have been a DN myself for 5 years, and have been consulting other DNs on tax planning and residency in tax friendly places. After talking to about 300 DNs I noticed I often explain the same basic principles over and over. And I see people ask the same questions on forums as they did five years ago. So this year I created an Ebook explaining exactly how to deal with taxes as a DN. In the hope we can start putting some issues to bed once and for all?

Let's see how this goes: if any of you have any questions/remarks/frustrations related to tax, residency, business structuring, etc., please state them below. I'll give my point of view based on my research and experience. Try to be as generic as possible, so that the discussion is interesting for everyone. So please no questions on your specific situation as ""I live in XYZ on an employment visa, what costs can I deduct to lower my tax rate?""

Do allow me the time to respond. I do not have the luxury to just blurt something out. And please leave your emotions at the door. I'll check in regularly the coming week. Happy travelling!

d8qvkn,4m7zu4aj,"""Moving"" to Mexico in October or November 2019. Can't decide between Playa del Carmen or Puerto Vallarta (or somewhere else?). I'd appreciate any feedback you can provide.","**TL;DR**: 33 year old dude that is a web developer and has previous experience as a DN wants to head to Mexico with a $1,200 monthly budget. I'm thinking of Playa del Carmen or Puerto Vallarta, but I'm open to other beach locations if I can learn to surf, also has cool day hiking, and is not super expensive.

**Work**

I'm a 33 year old US based dude that is also web developer that specializes in JavaScript, React, as well as backend with node.js. My current contract just ended here in USA, and I want to head back out on the road. I'm much happier not being tied down to an office.

At this point, I currently do not have a job since my contract literally just ended.

**Goals/Aspirations**

My primary goal is to take a lot of camera footage and post it online. My mother is disabled and her condition is worsening significantly. She often comments that she wishes she could see more of the world, but because of 1) finances and 2) health she is unable to travel.

Thus, I got some gear so I can take some wicked awesome shots that my mom can enjoy from her Nebraska home. I also want to learn to edit video/images so I could potentially freelance as a developer and/or video editor.

We'll see if I like it.

I have a Go Pro Hero 7 Black, small backpack sized drone, my smartphone, and my MacBook Pro. So, I'll start a blog, vlog, and upload stuff to YouTube so she can enjoy it.

**Background**

First, a little about me. I stayed in Guadalajara for 6 weeks back in 2017 and spend a total of $900. Then I stayed down in Ajijic for 12 weeks and I negotiated to stay at a hotel there for $325. I averaged $700 per month there, which included bus rides back to Guadalajara for some clubbing, then drinks, and food (of course).

I've stayed in Cancun, but when I was on my way to Playa del Carmen, it was raining something fierce, so I just kept going to Tulum, then on to Belize.

So, I have never been to Playa del Carmen.

I also backpacked through Central America after that, and I only stayed in Hostels for $6-12$ per night during my trip.

Once I got to San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua, I stayed at Nomad Life for 8 weeks for $12 per night.

My main point is to illustrate the type of lifestyle I prefer at least for now. Getting to meet new people at Hostels is more preferable than living in a condo on my own.

**Budget**

My budget for all of my living expenses is around $1,200 per month. I've already found a several places in both Playa and PV for $4,500 to $8,000 pesos ($230 to $450 usd).

So, the rest of my budget would be for traveling, food, nightlife, etc.

If I get bored, then I'd start looking for remote React/Redux jobs, or I could always return to the US.

What I'm Looking For

I'd love to find a place that I can learn to surf, but is not more than a 4 hour bus ride to some sweet day hiking spots. Basically, somewhere that I can shoot a variety of footage to upload so my mom can see some really cool experiences in her later years.

I'm not big into partying, but I enjoy going out once or twice a month.

I'm not a fan of cold. For example, even in Ajijic/Guadalajara during the winter, those mornings are chilly. You absolutely need pants and jacket at least. It gets ""cold"" as shit.

Alright, this is long. I just wanted to provide enough info about me to get some good perspectives on where to live in Mexico over the winter."

d98z9u,2lw98ihk,Asking for speed test from Airbnb host,"Hi, I'm just wondering how important it is to all of you to ask for a speed test from Airbnb hosts. I always question the hosts about speed and and tell them I need it for work. I only really need a minimum of about 5MBPs. I ask for speed tests but usually they only reply commenting on the speed. I'd like to trust a host with good reviews but prefer to know the speed. They often don't really know what I'm talking about when I ask for speed test and download speed results. I only speak mediocre Spanish and am usually asking Spanish speaking hosts so it can get a little frustrating to try to explain it. To top it all off hosts can send images until a guest has booked. How do you all handle this question of internet speed? Especially those of you in Latin America who don't speak fluent Spanish. I had a long lengthy exchange with a sweet host who just didn't really get what I was asking her and tried to get me to send her a message to send me the pic on WhatsApp but her number was blocked ok Airbnb. I still haven't found out the download speed and haven't responded in a bit just cause I am frustrated. I have another host with lots of good reviews who says the wifi is very fast and reliable but I am sensing another headache in trying to find out the specific download speed. How do you guys handle this? If there's a chain of messages explaining the situation and the host saying it's very fast, would Airbnb give me a refund if it's unusable?"

I hadn’t really pondered co-working spaces before this trip, so didn’t research beforehand.

Now I’ve had a few scenarios where they would be very helpful - rather than sitting in a courtyard monitoring battery life while talking to clients (or, worse still, incurring family wrath by talking loudly at 6am because of timezone differences).

The challenge I’ve had so far is that most of the places I’ve found don’t open until 8/9am and close by 6/7pm. I can understand that, especially for a casual member who only wants a day or two access, but it doesn’t help me.

For those with more experience: is a 24 hour co-working space too much to hope for? Or are they common enough and have I just been staying in the wrong areas?

(For context I’m in western europe right now; I also partly ‘owned’ a small coworking space back in Australia for a while that had 24 hour access, but only for long-term members.)"

I have had the whole medical work-up. I've been told that I don't have to worry about going permanently blind, but I have internal trauma behind my right eye that flares up when exposed to light-based triggers. The ocular migraines and blindness episodes are caused by that inflammation response to light-based triggers. I have been told that I will heal and that the ocular migraines will get better over time, but it could take a year or more. 

I'm on doctor's orders to spend no more than 2 hours a day on the computer, with breaks. I'm not getting any meaningful work done in that time period, it's just too short. I've lost all my old contracts and can't really bid for more. Nobody wants to work with someone who is only available ten hours a week. I also don't have enough time on the computer to properly market myself for new gigs. 

I've spent all my savings dealing with this, and even been floated some loans by friends. I almost never take loans, I hate being in debt. I've got no income coming in, my bills are due and I don't have the money for rent and food. This is really stressing me out. Stress is also a trigger for the blind spells, so this is a bad cycle.

I have my own nice little place in Guatemala that costs $100/month, with electricity and wifi included. I have a private bathroom with good plumbing. My place is lakefront so I swim and do my laundry in the lake. We cook communal soups on a wood fire, and I eat pupusas and fruit in the streets for about $5 a day. I can live comfortably but frugally on $300/month. $500 lets me have savings and some medical care.

I'm not interested in relocating for a wok/trade offer. I've got several options for that, but I need to be independent in order to feel secure. I have a good community here, I've built a life here, I want to stay.  I'm also not at a point where I want to go super rustic and just wait it out in the jungle with no money until I'm healed. I'm old, I'm blind half the time, and $500/month is not an unreasonable amount to earn given ten hours a week. That's $12.50 an hour. I usually bill a hundred. 

I just don't know HOW, which is why I'm consulting the hive mind. I need help solving the puzzle of ""how do I earn $500/month given 2 hours a day, 5 days a week...understanding that some days and maybe even some groups of days I won't be able to work my scheduled hours.""

Here are the resources I have:

A stable living environment

A Chromebook

Good Wifi in multiple places

A P20 Hauwei phone on a data plan that gives me unlimited Facebook and Whatsapp...so that gives me free international communications that is usually very high quality. 

I recently did an experimental market push on Facebook, using my personal profile and Facebook groups to promote an online tarot reading business. I got thousands of friend requests in a 24 hour period, but it was all just creep guys trying to blow up my Messenger. I'm currently repairing the damage. I may just start over from scratch with a new Facebook account. 

I'd like to have that kind of response again, but with a better-targeted audience. I tried FB ads and have gotten no response. I'd honestly like to just walk away from FB entirely. I just don't like it, it's overwhelming. 

I've thought about selling monthly subscriptions, thinking about income in terms of number of subscribers. $500/month is 50 subscribers at $10/month, 25 subscribers at $20/month, 10 subscribers at $50/month. Then I think about what I could produce that would be worth those amounts, how I would get subscribers, etc. 

The thing is, I can only spend about ten hours a week and I need money NOW. I also have no money to invest, and my health is just a day by day struggle. I've been forced into medical retirement without retirement savings, and I've got to figure out how to take care of myself. 

Any wisdom you care to share is appreciated.  Its like a Rubik's cube, and I need help solving it. I will answer questions as I am able, but please remember my screen time restrictions. My written conversations move slowly. Negativity will be ignored, I don't have the time or energy to waste on it."

Before getting into business, I thought the lifestyle of working from your laptop was absolutely amazing and wanted to do anything it took to be in that position. Turns out, after you see some success and look back on your journey, it is one hell of a lonely ride. Since I started, I haven't really left my hometown. It is small, lacks entrepreneurs and not much to do. I guess the point of this post, is that something is missing for me, and the scary thing is I have no idea what it is.   


I wanted to ask anyone who works from their laptop their experiences with solo travel. It is something I have been contemplating lately, but have no idea if I'd like it. I am a pretty social guy, and whats keeping me home is my close friends I grew up with. It gives me a social outlet, and an ability to detach myself from work.

- I'm from Canada, currently freelancing (self employed) working with U.S clients.
- I'm currently registered as a sole propriership in Canada although, I'm happy to register a new business here.
- Happy to spend a bit of cash on lawyers if necessary. 

I'm currently in Bulgaria right now although going back to Canada next week and planning on coming back in Feburary.

Any advice on this from someone who has done it before would be a HUGE help.

df0nao,chdzrt9,Recommended laptop stand and wireless keyboard?,"After working many hours with the laptop neck pain becomes a bitch. I think the problem is constantly looking downwards.

They need to be light and compact, you know how precious space is when travelling.

For stands I've read about ""The Rooster"", but it's like 70€ which is crazy. Why is it so expensive. There's a more affordable one, ""Next Stand"", for about 25€. Why the price difference? Any other recommendations?

As of keyboards, I'm looking for anything non-mechanical (bigger keys take up more space and I don't really like the loud noise), compact, light, rechargeable via USB and wireless/bluetooth.

\- Visited Colorado and Utah with my dad, getting in some hiking and camping. (Arches National park, woo!)

\- Spent a week in New Orleans with a close friend.

\- Visited Angkor Wat with another close friend.

\- Currently staying in Chiang Mai. (I know, it's digital nomad easy mode, but I'm still a beginner.)  


[I thought about bringing my laptop, but I didn't think I could con you guys into thinking I was doing work at Angkor Wat.](https://preview.redd.it/wbudowyxtbr31.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84c2b3ffb84b72debaba2883f83ded4bb5fb86ea)

I did plenty of research and preparation beforehand- I'm onebagging it with an Osprey Farpoint 40, and I did a five week trip over the summer as a trial run. (Went to Israel, visited family in the Midwest.) I'm really glad I did that trial run- it really helped me figure out a lot of little details. 

As for work- I'm a YA fantasy novelist, and while travel is a little disruptive to my writing schedule, all these new sights are seeing are doing amazing things inspiration wise. (And since I'm slow traveling, the writing schedule disruption isn't too bad.) Fiction writing is super well suited for the digital nomad lifestyle, too- I don't even need a particularly good internet connection. Hell, I actually get more writing done when I have a bad one.

I have been a digital nomad living in Asia for a few years now. The problem is that I do not make enough money to actually save. I know others do, so I imagine I'm doing something wrong (I don't spend much, so it's not spending, it's merely an income problem). I am a certified teacher from America with a Masters, so I know the default would be to do online teaching. I do have some private clients, but I cannot market myself beyond what I have cuz I don't speak the local language, and quite honestly, there is a lot of competition so Im not sure it would matter much even if I did. I  know lots of people teach with VIPKids, but thats not a good option for me cuz I do not do well with Sesame Street stuff. I was a high school teacher. The 'big smile, sock puppet' stuff isn't for me. I'm not dismissing it, I just accept that I don't have the skill set and/or demeanor for it. But I am open to opportunities beyond the teaching companies. I'm open to new gigs. I'd even be open to getting additional education if it wasn't too expensive and it paid off. 

I love the lifestyle, but I need to increase revenue now; I have to get health insurance and I'd like to eventually buy a house, so I am wondering if there is any way to actually make a good salary while being a digital nomad if you don't have any skills that demands high salaries (i.e. coding etc.).

dfyojq,1icvwvn8,Financially best place to establish residency,"Financially best place to establish residency 
Hi all!
I’m originally from North Carolina (lived here my whole life) and work from home. I have recently moved into my camper/trailer and will be traveling around the US with it towed behind my car. I have my work address set as my parents address so that is where all my mail, checks, and HR forms are sent (my parents scan them to me). Any form that has needed an address, I have used their address. 
My friend mentioned how I could change my “place of residence” (?) to somewhere that doesn’t have income taxes and get more out of my paychecks.

So here are my questions, is this really an option? how do I do it? Is there a time frame I will need to keep that as my address? How soon do I need to do it? Can I set my address as one thing and then set it up to be forwarded to my parents and everything still be ok? And what state would be the best option to have the least amount of taxes taken out of my paycheck? Will I need to do anything different for my car registration? Also, probably dumb question, is this shady in the sense of I’m gonna get audited/fined (?) if I do this the wrong way? 
 
Any ideas and discussions welcome! Thanks in advance."

I work for a company out of Texas and currently live out of Illinois. I'm 100% remote and wondered how people in my situation first notified their employers that they would begin moving somewhere overseas. Is this something that they can forbid? Specifically, I'm thinking about living in Europe for a year or two and changing cities every 2-3 months.


I do plan on returning to the states after, so I'm hoping the tax situation won't be too complicated if I leave a US address as my residence? I guess mainly I'm trying to figure out if I just leave and book airbnbs throughout Europe, will that be an issue at some point? I am in the process of getting my EU citizenship through my parents. That should completely eliminate any visa issues if they were to arise.


I have to use dual monitors to work, so it's going to be a pain to get all that around, but I think the experience would overall be worth it. What cities have you all lived in and recommend?

dh8gvc,2f8hmll,How To Travel Like A Digital Nomad with an Weak passport,"Every a couple of weeks I notice that someone from a country with a weak passport asking about how can they travel like a digital nomad if they have a weak passport so I thought so sharing my thoughts on how I travel like a digital nomad with a weak passport (Indian in my case)

If you are reading this you probably feel like it’s unfair. Well, you’re right! You’re completely right its fucking unfair that something that’s completely out of your control has such a big impact on your life.

> Is traveling with a weak passport harder than for our European/American counterparts? Yes

> Do we get discriminated at Imigration counters and Embassies all over the world? Yes

> Are we made to show a lot more documentation at embassies? Yes

But complaining about all of that doesn’t change anything

> We don’t live in an equal world, people will treat you differently for things that are completely out of your control eg where you are born or the colour of your skin.

Spending your entire life playing the victim doesn’t help anyone, especially not yourself.

##### Do what you can with what you have

How do you increase the ease at which you can travel the world with a weak passport?

###### 1. Make More Money (duh)

Sadly in an idealistic world, the amount of money you have shouldn’t matter but rather your character or merit should. But we don’t live in that kind of world.

In the world, we live in your bank balance matters, sadly. If you can prove that you are self-sufficient and won’t be a drag on the economy of the country you are visiting you’ll be accepted my easier.

Also as you make more money you can afford to reduce the friction of all your travels. Eg. I can afford to not think about a $10 dollar flight (that I don’t even take) that I buy just to show Immigration officers when I fly into Indonesia.

###### 2. Get a US/ UK or Schengen

Spend some time and invest and try to get a long term US/UK or Schengen visa.

Just their US visa can make your travels sooo much easier.

Here’s just a few countries that I can visit without a visa with my Indian passport + US visa combination:

- 6 months visa free: Mexico and Peru
- 3 months visa free Guatemala, Honduras, Argentina, Chile, Columbia, Albania, Georgia, Serbia,

And a ton more countries for a month each. In fact I’m currently writing this from Albania and the US visa made my visits (3 so far) to Albania possible.

Is getting a US visa Easy? No. Worth it? Hell yeah Yea!

###### 3. Buy a passport or Get a new residency

If you have the dough you can always find investment opportunities that give you residency or a passport.

- 650k Euro for A Malta Passport
- 250k Euro for a Greek residency
- $1 Million for a USA residency
- 2 Million Pounds for a UK residency
- 2 Million Euro for a Cyprus Passport

The list is endless…

However, you can also get a new residency or passport going down a different path: It usually requires moving to a new country and working there (full time). Eg. Getting a green card, becoming a Canadian resident, studying in Germany and then working etc….

I wouldn’t recommend that if you want to travel full time because it’s a decade long commitment before you get results. But if you’re interested in going down this path check out the subreddit  r/IWantOut

###### 4. Be exceptional

One of the best advice I give freelancers is the title of Carl Newport book, “Be so good they can’t Ignore you”

The same thing applies to countries and visas, if you are at the top of your field ie the best at what you do, countries will start opening its doors to you.

If you have been featured on covers of multiple magazine I doubt you’re sitting at home googling “how to travel with a weak passport”.

Fun story: I once was interrogated by immigration officers in Indonesia and I showed them my blog and how I travel and they was amazed and followed my Insta haha!

Caz and Craig from Ytravelblog, [got a USA green card by been in the top of travel blogging.](https://www.ytravelblog.com/getting-green-card/)

I feel weird about things like this because on one hand its saying that “some people are better than other people” but on the other hand we live in a world where countries are closing borders to normal people but selling passports as above. I feel like merit based is better than just cash, but I still don’t know how I feel about this.

###### 5. Empathy

Understand what your visa/immigration official wants and try and give them that and beyond. Eg if you are dress like a bum when trying to enter Thailand don’t be surprised if you are asked some additional questions.

You don’t want to seem like a desperate guy trying to get laid, you should act like you have options (because you do!)

> Hey, I want to visit your country but if you don’t want to let me in then go screw yourself and I’ll go to your neighbor and spend my $$s there!

I wrote more about it on a post here: [https://jeremynoronha.com/indian-passport/](https://jeremynoronha.com/indian-passport/) including how I spent a long time (months) in over 30 countries + other tips to become a digital nomad.

dhar20,7ata3,Credit card abroad,"Hey,
I’m looking for a credit card to use while I travel abroad in south east Asia. I’ve found three cards that seem to be great but I was wondering if anyone has any experiences with them.

The other one is N26 account. It offers free payment in any currency and if you pay 9.90 euro a month you get free ATM withdrawals in any currency. 

The third one is curve card which states that it delivers a fee free foreign exchange as well as fee free foreign ATM withdrawals up to 200£ for free. (you can bump this til 400£ by paying 10£ a month)

didcef,,Careers suitable for the Digital Nomad lifestyle that don't require a college degree?,
diioyf,9ooxf,Do you ever think about getting an office?,"It seems the majority of people here are either software devs or work odd jobs wherever they go. I'm a bit different as I'm more of a startup person so things I work on can span years with different levels of input requiring different amounts of time. Some things it's possible to step back and take an advisory role and that works great with being a digital nomad, but now I want to start something new.

The startup I'm working on now can be largely built through digital interfaces, but at the end of the day has hardware products at its core. I travel around in a van with a trailer so I can build basic prototypes on the road and have a workstation in the van. However, I know neither of these is optimal.

So other people early on might ask whether they should rent an office or work out of their home/garage, but I'm more limited than that, but still in a similar predicament.

Should I rent a cheap place to sort of put my head down, while still doing a bit of travelling to nearby areas? I can chose a location with a decently low price and plan on building a remote team if things go well. Or should I keep building things out a bit slower and wait until I really know things will work out?

It's probably hard to give a definitive answer so I guess I'd be most curious about anyone who has been in a similar situation, what they decided, and how it turned out."

I could go for the “self-learning path”: working a year on-site and then asking for a remote position. But, I see many serious employers asking for some kind of BSc/MSc in “Computer Science or related fields” and I want to make me as “employable” as possible.

I have the chance of doing a part time 2 year MSc in Data Science (CS related field, check), for free.  I can’t go for a CS Master’s, don’t have the requirements.

diva3i,wfaci3q,How could i find shared flats with fellow nomads? (business op incoming?),"when looking for appartements i am either looking on airbnb or on local appartement sites...

airbnb has a great interface and is a great plattform ... but prices are high(er).. its great for short term stays.

local sites are great if you want to stay 6 months+ .. prices are often way lower but it is in general a bit more work and hassle...


i always asked myself - is there a website where i could share a flat with another person (but not a local.. or maybe a local but someone who is also a freelancer/entrepreneur/whatever)... or where i could find people who look for short term roommates?

i want the lower prices of a long term rental.. but also some connection with people who are at least a little bit involved in the whole ""digital nomad stuff""....  but without paying 1000$ for some cool and hip ""co living"" stuff."

Beginning life as a kind-of adult now...

After a few years of stalking this subreddit I have finally reached a time where I am able to take some liberties and just do the damn thing! I have been saving for a few months and setting up my freelance/remote work, and will have around $20,000 saved before my ideal departure in the beginning to middle of January. I am also a 21yo female who will be travelling with a friend, working while travelling. I don't have too many strict preferences in mind, of course just some good internet, good weather, easy mobility, and general safeness (for young women). I can be frugal, so budget is around $500-$900USD/month.

I had been thinking for some time now about going to Ubud or Uluwatu, Bali, just to get a completely different change of scenery from the city and cultivating a healthier, generally more positive lifestyle. A lifetime of city hustle makes me want a balanced destination of nature and culture (ie. shit to do/variety to see). However, I continue to see a lot of negative posts about Bali (mostly complaints of over-tourism, poor infrastructure, and excessive traffic) so I would love to hear some other recommendations for a lil newbie starting off in this lifestyle. I am continuing to do tons of research, but would love to hear from those of you who are experienced! I am open to suggestions of all kinds.

Peace and love :) Thanks!"

The position itself has started out with a mix of 1/2 in office and 1/2 at home, but it is going to be transitioning to be 90%-95% home based. I live in the same city/state as my company so I am not having to travel to come into the office.  My company is an international company with offices all across the globe, so they aren't a US exclusive country. That being said, my specific position within the company is not one that is at these international offices.

How should I approach my work/boss about seeing if I can become location independent, with the specific goal to move internationally? My job as it is right now is in fact coded as 100% remote, so contractually speaking my job is not tied to a specific location.

I went Freelance for 2 years ago, from spending time in an office with amazing co-workers to working from home and getting more and more isolated. The first 5 months were the worst and I seriously considered going back to the office just for talking with people. Then I overcame it by starting working from cafes. It helped, especially since I could work with another Freelancing friend. But since I also moved out of the city and become comfortable with not leaving my house, I gradually lost old friends and also my social skills.

Now I decided it's time to regain my lost social skills by implementing other changes in my life a Freelancer.

Anyone else here who went freelancing and got bugged by the lack of or reduced social life? What is your story? How did you solve it?"

I am planning on moving out pretty soon so I can  get closer to my goal, but I'm unsure what I'm actually going to do. For now I'm just going to work at a full-time job and a part-time to save money, I have a sizable amount saved right now.

While at the job, I started a few successful e-commerce stores, but nothing life changing.  I was doing that for about a year and a half until I had to call it quits because I wanted something more out of life.  I went back home to my parents to save money, went back to an old job installing solar panels(i do like physical work sometimes) and tried to start a web-based company doing design and marketing (semi-failed but succeeded in many ways) And now, I finally secured a job with a digital marketing company working directly with a pro pretty much full time, in which he said I can work anywhere in the world!  

So basically the situation I have now is: I'm working remotely with a great company, I have a few of my own low-paying clients from my company, and I'm living at home.  I don't have any debt, but also do not have too much money saved up (about 4k) bc of college and rent.  My work is good, I want to start some side hustles to go along with my job (haven't figured that out yet but always been an entrepreneur) while continue to get more freelance clients of my own.  While I'm not getting rich anytime soon, I feel like I'm on my way and have a decent income for the present.

I would love to travel as most digital nomads do.  Do you suggest to wait a bit to save up money or should I just go for it?

dof6g1,6cdiu,Buenos Aires vs Medellin for 4 months this Winter/Spring?,"I’m   trying to decide where I’m going to spend February-May 2020. I’ve   narrowed it down to either Medellin, Colombia or Buenos Aires,   Argentina. Both seem to be very popular digital nomad cities at similar   price points and with similar amenities.

I have been to Medellin for 2 weeks and loved it. I have never been to BA.

Here are my considerations:

* Size   and greenspace: I’ve been living in big, concrete-jungle style cities   for the last 3 years and am longing for something a bit more manageable   in size with more green space.
   * Medellin seems better for this. I keep hearing people talk about how monstrous of a city BA is.
* Sunlight/weather: I like the heat and love me some sun.
   * While   Medellin isn’t lacking in either department BA will have 2-3 hours  more  of sunlight a day during these months and will be hotter.
* DN/remote community
   * Both   cities seem to have pretty solid DN communities, however I get the   impression Medellin’s is bigger especially when compared to the cities’   sizes.
   * I’m also interested in a coliving, if anyone has any recs for these either cities they’ll be much appreciated.
* Culture
   * I've   heard BA is ""the most European city in latam"". I get the feeling the   culture there maybe slightly more similar to the Western cultures I'm   used to than Medellin.
* Language: hablo espanol como uno gringo
   * I found the Spanish in Medellin relatively easy to understand. BA is known to have a tricky accent.
* Safety
   * They seem to be similarly safe/unsafe. However according to Numbeo Medellin is a bit safer.

What   have your experiences in these cities been like? What big differences   outside of the above are there that I may not be aware of? I'm   interested in the above points but also any general wisdom on them,   especially from someone who's spent a decent chunk of time in them, will   be much appreciated.

I am planning to start out as a digital nomad from about May 2020 on. My plan is to fly to SE Asia (Thailand) and then travel to Indonesia afterwards. I want to stay in ""digital nomad hotspots"" for hopefully some networking with other nomads and learn from them. I am not that sure if my savings will be enough and would love to get some feedback of more experience people. :)

My savings at this time will be about 7k $ (flights and equipment for the trip already deducted from this budget). This will be my budget for accommodation, food and everything during my stay. So it everything goes wrong, I would have these 7k as a backup.

To my background: I currently work as a team lead for design and frontend development and plan to work as a full-time freelance designer / developer from this time on. Besides my full-time job, I always freelanced every now and then but never looked pro-actively for clients. All clients I have had so far all contacted me, so I don't really know how well it will work out when I have to start acquiring clients on my own.

Under the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE), I don't have to pay *income tax* on earnings under $103,900/yr, but that doesn't mean a $0 tax bill.

It looks like we're still required to pay 15.3% for social security and medicare when working for a U.S. employer. If you're a contractor it's called a self-employment tax ([\[1\]](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/self-employment-tax-social-security-and-medicare-taxes)), if you're a full-time employee it's called social security and medicare [\[2\]](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc751).

drewj6,ycopghu,Do you email clients outside of normal working hours?,"I have just started working remotely and my clients are on the other side of the world which means a big difference in timezones. i tend to do my work first thing in the morning but this is after close of business for them so i just schedule my email to send when business opens for them the next day. i feel this looks more professional. 

the downside is that it means my response times are much slower than they used to be and im worried it might cost me business. responding within 24 hours i believe is still acceptable but when it used to be 30 minutes it might cause issues with things that require some back and forth dragging out to days

Do you think emailing clients outside their normal business hours is less professional or creates a bad impression? I guess it would be different if they knew you were remote but when you are trying to run a business that has always been (up til now) local you dont necessarily want to advertise that."
ds0r82,13x9f1,"Long term project, Thailande"," Hello everyone,

 

I'm a French developer trying to work on a long term project, my research brought me to the idea of going to Thailand to keep working without spending much. I've seen lots of post from people doing Asia and Thailand seems to be the cheapest with best internet.

I'm planning on leaving before December at the latest, and staying for 6 to 9 months, not necessarily only in Thailand. 

 

My first question would be which city to choose to get something nice to work from ( I have a screen with me and desktop computer ) and It would be ideal to have a monthly expense of 400 euros top (accommodation + food ) ? (cooking myself)

 

Chiang Mai is a city that keeps coming in blogs or forums.

 

Should I go through airbnb for the first week ( visa requirement ) ?

 

About the visa, I saw that I could get a 60 days visa but I'm not sure if I'm not late for it, I tried calling them since the visa office opened in Paris but they don't like the phone, I only have online banking as well ( revolut, n26 and transferwise) which get me worry to get the proof of finance, they says it needs to be stamped by the bank. What do you think, should I try to get it before leaving ?

 

I don't have my flight yet, I'm planning on taking it a bit last minute or just before asking for the visa as it is a requirement.

 

I made my decision a bit last minute, just how I like it, so any tips about cities or what air company to take or where to buy it, ... is more than welcome.

 

Thanks for your help.

Edit: If you know of better plan like Colombia or even something in Europe, I'll take it."

My fiancee and I have been traveling for over a year now and feel like we have finally gotten in the groove of things... when we got a scary email from Google Fi. (We both use Google Fi and have been since we began traveling for 'unlimited' international data). 

The email states: `'you’ve been using Fi abroad for over 6 months, but Fi’s` [ `terms of service`](https://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/p/AFnwnKXAkX3Et9UcLyzJeTMGuRwmO1qpd_cO9WUcaQXCd89MZl9XXEpbh5MNjxJEXGCYPQ36GaR1qlP6EJrAjQRkW7vzeMU)  `require you to use our service primarily from a US address. This means we’ll need to suspend your international data roaming capabilities within 30 days, unless you start using Fi in the US again.'`

Obviously this is quite worrisome to us as Google Fi has been one of the most integral services of our travels. Has anyone come across this? Or know how to get around this? 

I'm thinking I can get around this like so: I have family in the US. I can order a new phone number through the same Fi account and get the SIM sent to my family. Tell them to plug it into an old phone they have lying around and just browse on it aimlessly for maybe 5 minutes a day or something. Could that work?

dsjug3,,Schengen Area confusion,"Sorry if this is not the proper forum, but the relevant gov resources are as unhelpful as one would expect, and you all seem decently knowledgeable on it, or at least much more experienced than I am. 

My question: I am a US citizen with a residence card in Germany. While I have this, am I still limited to 90 days in other schengen area countries? Does the residence card get me into other EU countries while valid? 

I entered the schengen area almost two months ago, and got approved for residence one month ago. Does that mean my 90 days visa-free has run up two months? Or one?

Since the residence visa is not a passport stamp, it looks like I’ve been traveling as a tourist in EU for two months. Does that mean that after next month, or 90 days from entering the EU, I can no longer leave germany? Or will I still have 2 months of travel since the last one was spent here with with residence?

I assume I should travel with both passport and card, since the passport alone has one stamp that expires soon."

dtig78,fcqbznd,Canadian Tax advice for any kind of nomad,"First off, I'm not an international tax lawyer, so there may be small bits here that are personal opinion or not 100% correct.  But, I have been a ""nomad"" for up to 7 years in my life, not contiguously, but for at about the last two years yes - in a row.

In my second stint as a nomad, which lasted about 4 years, I had been working in a variety of countries (not Canada) and became worried about the tax issue because I had been making a lot of money and was legally paying taxes in each country since I was working for real subsidiaries of my parent company in all those countries.  Most digital nomads don't have this kind of financial setup because they are technically considered their own small business and manage their own income as they see fit - which ultimately means that somehow they have to figure out their own taxes.  In my case, I properly filed for tax refunds in those other countries and had near or all of my taxes, including pension contributions refunded -- but at some point I realised that all this money is still considered taxable in Canada because they ""deemed"" me a resident FOR TAX PURPOSES.

So my first caveat here to any Canadian residing abroad is to NOT make the assumption that just because your residence is abroad (or planning to be abroad), that this is the same thing as residency for tax purposes.  Think of this as a question of ""where do I physically reside?"" and ""where do I financially reside?"".  Two different things.

Luckily, I had corporate resources and given access to top notch Canadian international tax lawyers of the type that major corporations hire and cost about $750 per hour just to speak to on the phone for non-binding advice, this kind of resource is not affordable to your average digital nomad.  The summary of all that chat was that since I had not filed the NR73 determination of non-residency for tax purposes before I left, I was still on the hook for all that income to be taxed even though I lived outside Canada and income generated outside Canada.  The upside though was that since my income went  to bank accounts outside Canada, CRA had very little visibility into what I, or even that I might be, earning income somewhere else.  So the firm's advice was literally ""wait and see if CRA contacts you, and don't worry about what to do about it because that issue is already water under the bridge.  If they contact you, come back and you'll have to sort out a mass amount of complex paperwork.  If you've been away continuously though for more than two years, and not drawing on any social programs in Canada like EI, health benefits for yourself or dependents, then generally you can make a case, even after the fact that you, in ignorance, did not complete the NR73 before leaving.""  This is a defacto gamble then, if you earn any income abroad without having filed non-residency-FOR-TAX-PURPOSES before leaving.  Note that if you have signed up to any kind of travelling insurance policy that requests your Canadian province, then you ARE drawing on Canadian social services because the costs of those insurance plans are hedged on risk that your provincial health plan will kick in most of the finances of that claim since technically you look like nothing more than a tourist.

So, heeding that advice, the next time I became a ""financial"" nomad (only slightly different than a digital one), I researched myself for quite a while about the pros and cons of filing that NR73 before leaving.  Most legal firms in this industry will advise you NOT to do the NR73 because it gives the CRA a lot of information that maybe you want to conceal later - their real motivation is however that they want your business so that you purchase their services either to fill out the from in your favour, or to catch your unicorn if CRA comes calling down the lane.  These firms are working for themselves, not the Canadian government, as they of course are bound by all the same laws that everyone is in Canada regarding tax.  So, take all their advice with a grain of salt.

My advice, is to do the form, because it gives you piece of mind via protection provided by CRA's decision regarding what they consider to be your deemed non residency for tax purposes; and really, it's only their opinion that matters, otherwise you are stepping into tax evasion status that will land you in much bigger fines or even jail.  On top of that, most aspiring digital nomads really do qualify as non-resident for tax purposes, so it's in your interest to understand to the best way possible how to get that status, at least filed before you go.

The primary thing that CRA is looking for, is whether or not you plan to return to Canada.  If you do plan to return, then their interpretation (the only one that matters) is that you're liable for whatever you earn outside of Canada regardless how or where you earned it.  You can try to hide income, but that's tax evasion, and very illegal, and a problem you don't want whatever your income might be.

The way they decide if you plan to come back or is not at all a secret, because Canada is a rule-of-law country that really does respect the law.  CRA does go to great length to provide you all the information you need to know how to determine what your future tax status is likely to be.

CRA's website starts with a very easy to understand ""summary"" of how it is determined.  As all digital nomads know, this doesn't really apply to their situation as while they ARE actually non resident of Canada, they're not exactly resident in any other country either.  This is where the typical digital nomad's wishful thinking starts to play a catch22 with themselves.

If you ARE physically, factually resident in a different country, then THAT country considers you a resident for tax purposes as well (usually), same as Canada would - even if it's just for a few days.  How this tax income is shared between CRA and your host country is strictly defined in tax treaties that Canada has with most other countries in the world, because all ""organised"" countries with a functioning government are also looking for ways of their citizens or guests from avoiding paying taxes that the host country has decided you are entitled to.

So, NR73's/CRA's strategy is mostly about deciding where you are resident or not, so that it can agree with all the other countries in the long list of countries with which Canada has tax treaties to figure out how to split up your income.  To be transparent about this process, eventually CRA's website will, if you dig deep enough, just point you to the tax treaties themselves and be something like ""OK here's the real legalese, have at it yourself and if you can't figure it out, then either hire a lawyer or fill out the NR73 and we'll do the work for you.""

As most digital nomads know, figuring out whether you ""technically"" live more in country A or more in country B is a main and easy step for CRA to say ""Aha!  You remain deemed tax resident in Canada."" which is of course their primary goal.  So they'll look at things like do you have property in Canada to which you could return and live at any time? do you keep a vehicle or other capital assets in Canada if so why?  Do you keep credit cards or bank accounts in Canada if so why?   Where will you actually be living when you leave Canada, if you don't know, why not?  What is your bank account in that other country, if you don't have one nor plan to have one, why not?  Do you have dependants who are staying in Canada, why are they not coming with you?  etc. etc.

These are all ways for them to agree with countries in the tax treaties about who gets your cake if either one decides to come along some day and try to claim it.  None of these questions by themselves can actually be a deal breaker, but in their summary and at the opinion of the experts at CRA they offer to give you an informed answer that is mostly binding unless your situation changes significantly.

Even the NR73 form is a simplified way to help CRA make a judgement that applies from the moment you file it, but can take about 4 months to process and for you to receive an answer.  By then you, like I was, will probably be in some other host country happily working and drooling over those tax free dollars.

If you own any kind of corporate account in Canada, that i a legal person and is taxable, full stop.  There's no way to argue yourself out of that box.  The exact same thing is true for most other ""liveable"" countries in the world, full stop.

Over the years, many very clever people have come up with many very clever ways to somehow fall outside of the decision matrix that is codified in Canada's (and other's) tax codes, and therefore Canada's tax code grew increasingly complex to deal with all these cases one by one.  All of those laws are in the deepest part of the CRA's code, which is transparently presented online in a single large document, although can be extremely time consuming to find the bits that pertain to YOUR exact situation.  This includes trying to use what Canada and other countries deem as ""tax havens"" and relatively recently, includes the bit that pertains to digital nomads.

That claim is regarding the ""perpetual traveller"", which kind of comes at all the of the embedded ""IF (this case) THEN (this decision)"" statements in the law, viewable online.  If a person, like a digital nomad, doesn't fit into ANY of the categories strictly defined above, then they just default to a ""perpetual traveller"" and continue to owe tax to the last place where they owed tax according to the above rules.  The rather true assumption is that every living person has to be physically SOMEWHERE at any given time - there is no way to claim that you don't exist, unless you're dead.  This is a catch all to ensure both countries in tax treaties can agree, and also a catch all for those who find some crack in the rules in a country that is outside tax treaties or tax blocs.

It's iron clad and ends you up in a case something akin to what my billionaire tax lawyer said in the very beginning.

My summary advice then, is to fill out the NR73 form honestly unless you are actually willing to gamble with the practice of tax evasion in the future.  Once you are declared non-resident for tax reasons, your (almost) totally off the hook from Canada.  It doesn't mean you're off hook in every other country you go to, but CRA won't care anymore because they can say ""Hey country XYZ, that's your problem now to collect that cake.""  If you live in different countries on a regular cadence, and make less than a million $ a year, then those countries are all going to decide ""ok who cares, this goes into the too-expensive-too-investage bin.""  Just be careful, abdicating your tax or physical residency means you suddenly lose a lot of Canadian social benefits that you may have taken for granted, and will create different tax rules for property or debts you may already have in Canada.  It will also complicate things when and if you ever do return and want those benefits of residency again.  Also, keep ALL your records and copy of passport stamps so you can CLEARLY indicate ""ok from dateA to dateB I was in countryX.  May account in countryZ had debits and credits of $n.""  This will take a lot of your time, probably, unless you do it secretly along the way.  Submitting all that data will baffle the reader and they're very likely to just officially give up on trying to collect anything.  The chance that any country though would even make that request is near 0% if you're always travelling on tourist visas between tax blocs.  Also, be aware that tax blocs (one is in Europe similar to the EU countries) that all your information is shared and compiled so.... ""they know"".

(NB: the only real exception to these bilaterally standard sovereign agreements is the United States.  Sorry Americans, there is no NR73 form for you and you are forever bound to the tax laws there, until you give up that American Passport.)"

The thing is, I’m not “most cases” because I’ve lived in both Russia and the US.  Russian is my first language and my English sounds flawlessly Californian.  So my question is: how critical is a bachelor’s degree to being able to obtain work in this field?  How important is certification (ATA)?  What are my chances of getting work without either one?  Like I said I am prepared to do further study and examination, but I’m not sure I want to commit to a bachelor’s degree.  Will ATA certification without the degree help my chances?"

I could barely afford to move out but it would not be a great situation (rooming house, not going out much, not much savings to reinvest in business, etc)...I live in a high cost of living city.

About me: I’m a 25M van lifer and two years ago I quit my job to travel. While traveling I landed a role performing different kinds of audits at professional licensure testing centers. In short - I was hired to cheat on professional licensure exams, like real estate, TSA Agent, occupational therapy, etc. After doing this for an entire year while I traveled, I decided to start a company hiring other travelers and nomads. We currently do 400+ audits/year in the US & Asia.

The job:

My company, Krotz Services, LLC is in need of hiring 1-3 more people in SE Asia/Indonesia to perform audits or “secret shops” at testing centers. We will also be hiring 5-10 auditors in China. 

Secret shop audits take 45 mins - 1 hour and pay $125 for the first 10 and $150 thereafter. 

Objective:

The purpose of preforming a secret shop/audit on a testing center is to:

1.) ensure that these test centers are operating up to standard and in accordance with regulations.

2.) audit the diligence of test center associates by attempting misconduct 

3.) observe the physical features of the test center and their ability to securely record information. 


To inquire:

We would prefer to stay on Koh Tao. We have recently started scuba diving and we plan on getting our Advanced Open Water Certification on Koh Tao. We want to be diving as much as we can when we aren’t working. I figured staying on Koh Tao would make that easier. However, I have heard, and read here, that the internet is not so great. The posts I see here are a couple years old though, so maybe that has changed? I have also heard that people will use their phone as a hotspot in order to get online and teach. Is this a possibility? We plan on doing this as a backup anyway.

A little more about us if it matters. We aren’t party animals, but do enjoy going out every once in a while. Or unwinding after work with a drink or two. We love hiking and going to the beach. Not looking for something super touristy, but I know with these three choices that might be hard to avoid.

e11wzk,4v17tbug,Nomad here looking for some advice!,"Hi there, I'm looking for advice for what to do next.

So basically, when I was younger I wanted to be an Aerospace Engineer, so I did well at school and studied it at Uni. After my placement year I travelled to Canada and my eyes opened to travel. I went back to final year and had smaller trips to Morocco etc. and then ended up selling my stuff, packing my bag and hitchhiking around Europe. 9 months later I came back to finish my degree. Got a girlfriend, and one of the best grades in my year. I looked for a way to make money and found a Udemy course teaching me how to publish ebooks to generate a passive income. Put a lot of effort publishing one exercise book, following the course to the T. Realised this is not gonna sustain me and got an unfulfilling, highly paid graduate job. Persued dropshipping through shopify and fb ads. 3 months later, after making some sales but a loss I quit and persued publishing instead, having seen the money from that single ebook increasing every month. Systemised everything, invested in software, published another 10 books, set ambitious goals. Quit my job 3 months later after realising that I could sustain myself from publishing (only just!). Travelled to Poland and Turkey, working along the way. Then amazon deleted my books and gave me a lifetime ban after some of my books violated a trademarked work - 'kindle', in the title of the book. Went to a hippie camp for a month. Went back to UK. Decided to become an English teacher instead, took a course then went to China to teach. Worked for 7 months in a school. Well paid job. Then quit and went to Vietnam. Taught English part time. Got another gf (I split with the last shortly after graduation).  Used up my 3 month visa a flew back to UK. Worked over summer in a summer school and then started my current trip. I went to eastern Europe, hitchhiking and camping, travelling cheaply like I normally do. However I stupidly didnt predict the winter cold so I ended up spending my money on hostels. I searched for warmer countries and sent off many workaway requests. I got on that accepted in Israel so I took the next cheapest flight to Israel. I am now volunteering in Palestine in a natural history museum and loving it! And im not spending money, which is essential in a costly country like Israel. But my money has all run out. I need to save the small amount I have to afford a flight out. So basically I want to ask you all on Reddit for suggestions of online work I could do. I have at least a month longer at this workaway and I have internet. I also have my chromebook with me (no super fast laptop unfortunately). I have dabbled with online teaching before but the hours were inconvenient and I didn't enjoy teaching badly behaved chinese kids over the internet - I prefer adults, which I havent found an online job for. I put up posters around universities in Ukraine to try to get teaching work but no response. I am taking a python course because I want to get my code up and running again in order to automate the keyword research for the kindle publishing business but I will be redoing the work I did already and feel really unmotivated to do it. I'd be starting again from zero. Also I don't find the work so meaningful anymore because the quality of some of the books was poor and I don't fully agree with the business model ethically. I thought that I might be able to find work as a programmer but I realise it'll take at least a year or so until I get anywhere near good enough to get paid doing it. I have a client upwork account - I hired programmers, VA's etc in the past. But I dont have a freelancer account because of the competition. I applied to do copywriting but it wasn't accepted.

So... cut a long story short, I am asking for advice - some ideas maybe for what I could do to make some money online. I am here in Palestine, working on projects to protect biodiversity in the area and I'm learning so much which I love, but I have no money and am really anxious right now for the future and what to do. I have no idea what I want to do but I love to travel and do meaningful work but I also need to live (make money to eat). Thank you so much for reading this far and I appreciate any ideas or advice you might have. I would love to travel around Israel to understand more of the political situation here by visiting settlements etc. And then Jordan. But I need to save up some money first."

e15h53,,Looking for some solid advice.,"Hello nomads, this is my first post here.
I'm a 27yo M, and I'm looking to embark on my nomad journey. After a bit of a struggle, I managed to land a remote job which pays $800 a month, which I understand is on the low side. (5 days a week, 8 hours a day) The job is something I've always wanted to do and there's potential for growth. Most importantly, it's 100% remote. I love the Latin culture and I've always wanted to learn Spanish, so South America is a no-brainer destination. I have a couple of questions regarding this.
1. Is it realistically possible to live off such a small budget? I understand it depends on each individual, but is $800 a month in general, a workable budget in Latin America? (And about $2000 in savings after flight tickets, insurance etc) I prefer a relatively frugal lifestyle - dinner/drinks on the weekends and some touristy stuff. Decent accommodation with strong internet is my priority. 
2. Any specific travel destinations in SA? I'm looking to learn Spanish and prefer a city with good internet and outdoor physical activities like hiking, trekking, surfing etc.

Any input would be appreciated, thank you kindly.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for all the advice. You've all given me a lot to think about and research.I will definitely increase savings before making the jump. And also take into consideration all the destination recommendations that I hadn't considered before. Have to say, this is a wonderfully helpful community. Cheers guys."

We just financed a used Jeep Cherokee that’s about a year old with the intention of driving around the country looking for a new place to settle. The problem is finding short term accommodations has been horrible, especially short notice. Airbnb is absolutely awful now, with crazy deposits and $250-500 cleaning fees with no discounts for monthly rentals (in fact many states and cities now ban anything over a few weeks). Vrbo is just as bad if not worse. 

I’ve got about $2k per month budgeted for accommodations and can flex to $2,500 if I have to. After a month of looking we’re nowhere closer to finding a place to ride out the winter. Is there a company or another service or site that runs corporate apartments at reasonable prices with no hidden fees that we can rent in different cities for 1-3 months at a time? Don’t need anything fancy, just a queen size bed, kitchen so we can cook, and good enough internet so I can work.

We’ve also been checking Craigslist’s but that’s equally been a bad experience and availability is awful on the West Coast so far.

e2xaar,14cb1n,Is this style of affiliate marketing potentially very profitable?,"I am completely new to the world of affiliate marketing. I stumbled across this youtube channel which posts a video every 2 weeks that upload videos like ""top dash cam to buy in 2019"". The video is then a simple edit of say 5 dashcam commercials back to back with an intro and outro. They aren't garbage but are a simple edit considering the commercials are already made. 

The video gathers between 50k-100k views and the channel has been posting well for 4 years. Each product is linked to amazon then below. 

with views like this is this potentially a profitable channel?

e3ojhu,f8k4jcp,Become a digital nomad on the island paradise of Reddit Nation," 

Hello all,

I am here with my plan for my [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditNation/) Reddit Nation

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

These are by far the hardest ways to make money in aff marketing and never workout well for anyone but the advertiser.

I have offers from tier 1 advertisers that pay you for getting people to opt-in to their email lists. It's far more profitable and scalable than anything that requires someone to fork out a credit card. I'd love to have some DN clients, so thought I'd chuck this up here.

e3zc3t,,It IS legal to work on a tourist VISA in some countries.,"Hi guys! I just wanted to chime in and mention it *is* legal to work (remotely to another country) on a tourist VISA in some countries. For example, where I live, Georgia, does allow this. I believe Albania also does (just some examples from my part of the world). I know that digital nomads feel that they are operating in a ""grey area"" but many countries have become aware of digital nomads and the laws are slowly changing to accommodate this lifestyle.

I wanted to point this out, because the mods over at r/iwantout are lying to people and saying that it's ""illegal"" to work as a tourist in every case, and banning anyone who points out that:

1. they are not legally qualified to make that judgement
2. it *is* legal to work while being a ""tourist"" in many countries

While I wouldn't consider myself a digital nomad (I have the digital part, but not the nomad, as I settled down in a country I really loved), I think being a digital nomad is a really good way for people to free themselves being stuck in their country, travel while still young, and achieve a better work-life balance. I know there's probably overlap between this forum and r/iwantout, and I don't want people to be discouraged by the lies the moderators over there are peddling, and their abusive, dishonest delusions about what the ""laws"" supposedly say (which they apparently they think they know about every country in the world).

I'm not sure if linking to other subs is OK, if it's not, mods please feel free to remove the link. Otherwise, I offer this for discussion and to clear up the facts. Thanks!"
e4emfe,rueu68g,"Been a digital nomad for 3 years but still struggling, need tips!","Hi Guys and Girls,  


I'm a Graphic designer of 8 years with the last 3 of those being remotely. I didn't have the most traditional start to becoming a digital nomad and hence, I don't think I developed the best habits over the last few years and am still struggling with certain aspects such as finding good clients and pricing myself correctly.   


I definitely have the skills to be successful as I know my ability. I have over 120 5 star reviews on various online platforms and have returning consistent clients however I still have less than $700 in the bank and I'm sick of working just to make ends meet. I love certain things that I work on, but also sometimes when my bank balance is so low I end up taking on work I dislike just because I need the money, this has begun a love / hate relationship with my career  and I've been considering quitting and maybe going back to working in an office, even though the idea of that simply feels horrible to me.  


Basically, I'm looking for help to I can figure out round about how much I should be reasonably charging and also a place where I can find consistent clients with higher budgets.  

My design background is predominantly based in fashion, and I design patterns and graphics for different menswear brands. However, I am a bit of a jack of all trades too and am often designing logos, Illustrations and other media for clients.  


Thanks for any help! I know a simple google could probably help find what I'm looking for but I also wanted to share this with the reddit world for some reason."

e4fux0,chdzrt9,Anywhere in Europe to spend about 3 weeks in January?,"I'm looking to spend somewhere in Europe (UE rather) in January where winter is not *too* miserable. I know pretty much anywhere in Europe winter is not a a walk in the park, but as long as it's not too extreme and I can have a decent time in ""alive"" city rather than in a ""bunkered up"" one I think I'm good.

I'm planning to go to Italy in spring for a few months, so Italy would be out of the question.

I generally enjoy cozy places with a young atmosphere and nightlife. Meeting people is a big chunk of my experience, so I'd rank popular places among DNs, Couchsurfers, expats and travellers higher up.

Disclaimer: I only started doing the DN thing partially this year and I'm someone who hasn't travelled much in his life (my passport isn't even stamped). I've always been in the UE ""safety"" bubble and although I'm changing that I'd like to do it gradually. So please if you suggest some place that isn't within the ""UE bubble"" please point out the considerations I should have, just so I know.

I have a bunch of places in my ""I want to go to"" list, but I don't actually know much about them. It's just places I've been recommended or that I've read about. For instance I have several places in Greece a Greek guy I met recommended, like Rodos, Crete, Naxos, Paros... but he also said they're pretty much dead in the winter and also that Greece and locals in general are not very traveller-friendly (his words). He said would be the only place ""alive"" in winter time, although I read it's kind of a chaotic city. I used to have good impressions about Thessaloniki, a university city and whatnot (my understanding) which is great, but another guy I met who lived there for half his life said it was kind of an ugly city.

Other places I've given a thought for this trip are Budapest, Malta, Gdansk (Poland in January is crazy but I figured since it's a coastal city the weather is milder?) and Belgrade or Novi Sad (not UE, I know). I've even considered going somewhere in my country (Spain) I've never been to, like Santiago de Compostela or Bilbao. Lisbon is also in my list but I want to spend there a longer period.

Please feel free to share your experiences on the places I've mentioned or make your own suggestions! I'd really appreciate it!"
e4gums,7596n,What would a platform like Glassdoor/LinkedIn but for remote companies look like?,"Hey guys,

I've been toying with an idea of making a database of remote-friendly companies. *""Are you serious?  Another remote work-related website? There are WeWorkRemotely, RemoteOK, FlexJobs and dozens of other job boards. Stop this madness!* I know, I know.. But hear me out.

All those websites are great in their unique way. My problem is that I always end up with 10 open tabs, googling various info about companies like their remote work culture, timezone coverage, CEO and team, reviews of past employees, etc. And every time I think to myself there should be a way to save my time and have this info in one place.

Now back to my original question. I have an unused ""remote**.com"" domain, plenty of free time till Christmas and this idea. So what do you think? Should I build it? If so, what information is important when you investigate a remote company you're about to apply to?"
e4k7zw,4tdwc,Anybody drawn to DN because the important things in their life are in many locations?,"In an ideal world I would have my family, friends, significant other, and a good job all in the same place.  If this scenario existed I don't think I would be drawn to DN. 

Unfortunately my parents live in the middle of absolute nowhere. There's no way I could work physically in my field there.

Most of my friends are in my college town, but this area also doesn't have the best jobs in my field. 

I met my SO internationally and they don't have the proper visa to stay in the US full time unless we get married, so we just spend part of the year together for now until we cross that bridge. 

I know it's not the only reason I pursue work as a DN, but all of these things are big contributors I think.  Is anybody else's life fragmented in a way that pushes them to DN? 

Sometimes I envy those who grew up in a big city, where jobs might be plentiful in the same place that their family lives, and they also have friends that stick around there because of the professional prospects."

My heart is telling to go for a more creative course such as 3D Animations, Graphics and I don't want to become some mindless ""Code monkey"" etc. but my brain is telling me to go for Computer Science, Comp Engineering or Cybersecurity as it means I will be able to get a decent paying job and possibly become a digital nomad after grinding out corporate work.

e62nt9,g9fxh,How to get a passport in a 3rd world African banana country (Future Nomad),"I live in a 3rd world African banana republic. I'm going to be a nomad next year, I hope, so step 1 in the paperwork department was to get a new passport. This is how it works in my banana republic.

STEP 1 - Ensure you have the right paperwork including the forms, birth certificate, passport photos, previous passport, copies of everything including your ID, tax info and the ID of the person recommending you to get a passport. 

STEP 2 - Find an agent to fill the forms for you. I know how to fill the forms online, but, you need someone to do it for you,  costs ~$5. If you fill it yourself, it will likely get rejected. Why? The regulations vary on a monthly basis, and only the agents have the new changes. They are not communicated, gazetted, or anything like that, but they are there. Make your payments online, and then they tell you which day to take your paperwork in for verification and submission. Lead time for this is around 30 days.

STEP 3 - Get my submission date, I have to wait 26 days. I don't have that time. 26 days in an African country is a lifetime. A coup could break out, war, floods, the machine making the passports could go down etc. So, I go to my barber, tell him I need a hookup. He calls around, comes back and tells me that there is a guy I have to bribe, and he will reduce my lead time and see me through a fast process. 

STEP 4 - Agree on the bribe. $50. No problem. He calls me the next day, tells me to login to the passport system, and now my lead time is reduced to 2 days. Sweet.

STEP 5 - 2 days later, go in, call him when I'm at the place. He sends a cop to come get me, takes me to the diplomatic section, goes through my paperwork, has my biometrics taken, mind you, I have to take digital passport pictures despite having brought in 4 passport pictures. Process is supposed to take a day, from 8.00AM to 4.00PM. Diplomatic side, 10 minutes, but we wait around an hour cause there was a power blackout cause of the rain and there is no backup system. Cop walks me out of the building, I handover my 50 bucks. Its 11.00AM. 

STEP 6 - Passport lead time is around 30 days. But like I said, our country is volatile. Shit could happen and the processing usually takes long. My 50 bucks is working for me. I have lunch, go back to work. 4.00PM, I get a call and text notification, your new passport is ready. 5 hours. Nice. Diplomats have priviledges. 


STEP 7 - Planning to pick it up tomorrow, but the bad weather cuts me off from the city for 4 days. 4 days later, go pick up my passport. Again, collecting is a whole day affair. I don't have that kind of time. My original 50 bucks is still good. Call the guy, he tells me to come to the building and call him when I get there. I do so, I see a queue, if you are doing it right, it snakes around the building, and it's raining and they been there waiting like 6 hours. And the chances of your passport getting 'lost' are very high. You normally have to pay around $20 for it to be found, in the guys desk drawer. Collection of my passport. 5 minutes.

Now I own a 10 year passport and don't have to go through that for the next ten years. I'm ready to be a nomad. I'm not proud of the bribe, but that is how the system works."

e6qbih,31xzq,"How to have a ""what's your rate?"" conversion with your clients (for graphic designers / developers)","Earlier this week, I PM'd another Redditor who wanted to raise their rates but didn't know how to have that conversation. I thought that it might be generally helpful to others in the community, so below is an excerpt I wrote to him. We also talked about portfolio framing and how to get more clients, so if that's helpful, I can share those too:

For some context, I used to run a web design firm. I started as a freelancer and built it up to 10 full-time in 5 years.

* Ok - so right upfront. Your work is really good. I think the weakest pieces of your portfolio are \[...\]  (I’d take those off your portfolio today). But if you take those away, you’re easily in the $65-$100/hr USD range of the market. Let me put it this way - there are definitely thousands and thousands of graphic designers out there charging that rate who aren’t as good as you.
* Remember that your new clients have no idea what you charged your old clients. So don’t feel insecure that suddenly you might be doubling your rate. It’s a new day.
* In order for you to feel a little more comfortable, I’d recommend you start thinking of yourself as a $65 USD / hour graphic designer. Here’s how the conversation will go:
   * **Client:** ""How much do you charge?""
   * **You:** ""My hourly rate is $65US/hour. I understand that as a business, you have a budget and you want to stick to it, and the last thing you need is to start a project that ends up racking way more hours than you expected. So, the way I work is that we do a half-hour exploratory conversation (which is free) where we discuss the scope of the project, what you’re looking for, what the final deliverables are, how many revisions we think we should budget into the process. After that meeting, I’ll provide you with an estimate of how many hours I think the whole project will need. I’ve done this enough times that I’m pretty accurate with my estimates (I think I’ve only had 2 projects this year go over, and even then it was only by 5%). If the estimate is within your budget, we can move forward, if not, we can discuss things that we might pull back - sometimes it’s limiting the revisions, sometimes it’s just as simple as having fewer meetings.""
   * **Client:** “What happens if we go over?""
   * **You:** “Keeping things honest and transparent is really important to me. No surprises. I will let you know as soon as I think the project might go over, and I’ll usually be able to tell before the project is even halfway done. I’ll provide a revised estimate or we can strategize on ways to pull back the scope.""
   * **Client:** “Can you give me even a ballpark on a project like this?""
   * **You:** “It’s hard to do accurately without the detailed conversation, but projects like yours have been in the range of $800-$2000. (make the range really big so that there’s real value in the conversation to narrow it down and so that they feel in control knowing that depending on the scope, they can change the budget significantly).
   * **Client:**  Alright, let’s set up this call""  OR ""Ah, that’s a bit too much for me"" OR ""Let me think about it.""
      * If they say it’s too much: **You:** “I totally understand. I love what you’re doing and your company though, so if you ever decide to invest more in the branding and visual identity of your venture, please hit me back. I’d love to work together.""
      * If they say ""Let me think about it"": **You:** ""Absolutely. It's critical to make the right investment when it comes to branding or visuals. You want someone who understands your business, your customers, and can be reliable and professional. I'll follow-up with you next Thursday.""
      * Note that in the above response, you're focusing the client away from the budget (which is likely why they're thinking about it) and towards the value you're providing. Make sure you promise to follow-up, and then actually follow-up. The follow-up is key and many people end up converting because it's just the path of least resistance. They will say ""I'll think about it"" or ""I'll shop around"" and by the time you call, they probably haven't had any time to do either - and they'll like that you took the initiative to follow-up. Always follow-up. Always follow up!

Bucharest is a known known, as I've lived there before.

I don't read Cyrillic, so Sofia could be problematic.

I've read mixed reviews about Zagreb.

e7b15y,nzcdb,Is this a valid reason to not travel to Mexico City?,"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/nov/12/tour-mexico-city-quirky-toilets


I’m a new digital nomad looking to start traveling for the first time and I’m trying to choose a place in Latin America. Initially I was sold on Mexico City but reading the above article has made me question that decision. 

It says that Mexico City’s sewage problem is very bad and human waste Earth below the city and eventually through the cycle that human waste ends up in the water and on the food. 

It also says Mexico City ranks No 1 in the world for gastrointestinal infections. “It is estimated that about 90% of adults in the city are infected with Helicobacter pylori parasites”

These things really make me reluctant to go to Mexico City because I don’t want to get sick and potentially pick up some parasites, especially if there are long-term consequences to it. It just seems like the benefits of the city don’t seem to outweigh this risk. 

For anyone that has been to Mexico City, is this a valid concern? Did you pick up some long-term infection or parasite? Obviously there will be some level of sickness, traveler’s diarrhea, etc traveling pretty much anywhere in South America but I’m wondering if this is more prevalent in Mexico City and whether there are any long-term effects of this?

I might just be overthinking this, but just trying to decide whether Mexico City would be a good place for a couple of weeks."
e7cdpc,7fy1emz,DN for over 4 years. I wonder how much estrogen I've in ingested over this period of time?,"A large point of digital nomadism is cost-of-living arbitrage. 

Oftentimes, that means living in places without reliable water supplies. Bottled water must be purchased daily to drink, sometimes even to cook with.

Which means a large portion of potable water is obtained via plastic containers. Food, also, is highly packaged. There's no way around it. 

I wonder how much estrogen has leeched into my water and thus into my body over these four years? 

Would it be any less than if I had just stayed in Manhattan or London? 

Or is this stuff so pervasive, it wouldn't have made a difference wherever I lived?

I am curious about potentially spending time living in South America (1-2 months) in a similar timezone without notifying my employer. I am not sure that living abroad would be allowed as no one else in the company does it, but I am not sure how they would even know if I just used a VPN that put me in a similar location in the US.

e8rhwq,35oz97ah,"How I went from Sleeping in the back of a van the night my father died from cancer, to running my own business and adding value to the world through writing.","I’m not making this post to try and play the victim card. I just want everyone to be inspired and believe in themselves. Even through the rough patches along the way to financial freedom. Here’s my story of how I went from the worst moments in my life, to making a living doing something that I’m great at. I’ve got to warn you, it gets a little dark. This isn’t going to be a perfect Christmas story, but I think it’s an appropriate time to relate with others.  

I want to tell you the circumstances that drove me to start my own business, and drop the wage slave lifestyle. It might sound silly, it might sound crazy, but it’s the honest truth as much as I can recall what played out. If you don’t like it, then I don’t know what else to tell you buddy. I want you to know that if you’re going through something like I did, then you are not alone. I used to think I was all by myself, but I know now that there are many like-minded people just like me who really understand what it’s like to think big and dream big.

2016 was the worst year I’ve ever had in my life. At the beginning of the year I got laid off, and then my car broke down. And, those were the happiest days I had that year. I spent my savings on a new car, and I used the rest of my savings to pay the bills. I went searching for work, and in the process, some guy ran a red light and hit me head-on. Yes, my car broke down, my job was gone, then my new ride got destroyed, all within two weeks time. Hold on to your horses, cause those aren’t the worst parts. I managed to snag a modest position locally for a job I was overqualified to do. I pulled the frame of my car straight with a friend’s pickup truck. I slapped some temporary off road lights on the hood to make it to my new night-job. I got stopped by the police frequently, but they showed me a lot of sympathy, because they could see that I’d recently been in a bad wreck, and that I was driving the wrecked car. I worked really hard to be the best at my new job, and I spent my first couple of paychecks on an old beat up Ram van to get to work. I moved in with family to save on living expenses while I searched for a better job. My savings ran out within a few months, and a few cars.  

Here’s the worst part: Right when I was turning things around, my father was diagnosed with cancer. I was taking my first day off to relax in months. A buddy from work invited me to go to the lake, and that’s where I was when I got the news. I tried to put everything on the back-burner, and I spent time with him at the hospital, then the nursing home, then by his bed side. He passed away within two months. The last conversation we had went like this:

“Don’t blame yourself. Don’t have any regrets over this. I want you to be the best you can be, no matter what anyone else thinks, and no matter what you think. Don’t hold yourself down, be the best you can be.”

I didn’t understand what he meant by “Don’t blame yourself” but, I definitely know why he said that now. For months I was totally devastated. Horrible family members rushed in to steal everything, and they wanted me gone. I was out the door the next morning, with nothing but a van, and less than two grand in my pocket. I kept to myself, became completely focused on my work, and I was ready for a big promotion. I’d gotten my own place again, and everything was awesome. Those words my Papa told me kept playing over and over again in my head.  

In 2017, my successful new career was finished and over with. I don’t know why the guy had to tell me his grand scheme against everyone, but I hope you can understand my position. Here’s the short story without giving out any personal details. We needed a new supervisor because one of them was let go due to almost killing someone on the job out of negligence. The old supervisor literally came within an inch of chopping a guy’s head off in front of everyone. I was asked if I wanted to fill the position, but a coworker of mine had just had a baby. I knew he could use the money to raise that kid, and I was single. I had all the money I could want already, and it wasn’t really a pay increase for me anyways. I got him the job, he was excited, and took me out for an authentic dinner from his home country. We got back in his new Mustang that he bought with the pay raise, and he told me this:

“Terry, I can’t stand black people. They’re lazy and they don’t want to work. I’m going to fire them all and replace them with white and Hispanic workers.”  

I couldn’t believe my ears. It blew my mind. I’m sure my jaw almost detached from my face. He wanted to fire the two best workers in the entire company and threw their names out during this horrible rant. I reported it immediately to the owners and demanded his resignation, and he made my life a living hell. Just to clarify, he had never said or acted like this at all, and he was not Caucasian. He wasn’t fired, but a few weeks later, I lost my position I had worked so hard to achieve. He pulled strings, filed false complaints, and pegged me as a liar. When I was called into the meeting and told I was fired, I said to them that I was never afraid to put my reputation and my job on the line for my friends, coworkers, and my fellowman. I’ve never regretted that.

Late 2017: I was back to square one. I lost everything for a second time, and I was completely fed up with the whole world at this point. I didn’t forget what my Papa told me on the last day he spent on this earth. I stopped to think, and I really took a deep look at my life. I asked some important questions, and those questions set me out on a very interesting path.  

What do Bill Gates and Warren Buffet have that I don’t?

If the wealthiest people in the world lost all of their money today, how long would it be until they earned it back again?

Do successful people have more hours in a day than I do?

Is there anything someone could say, that I couldn’t say?

What is the most important part of being successful in life?

I came to the conclusion that everything comes down to what you know, who knows you, and how you present yourself. The big revelation to me was that I had the same amount of time in a day, I could say the same words, I could make the right connections, and I could learn all of the knowledge I needed.

But what was it that separated me from people who were successful?

I narrowed it down to one simple concept:

Saying the right words, to the right people, at the right time.  

If I could find out how to say the perfect words to build a strong connection, then I’d be miles ahead of everyone else.  

Perfect words do exist in every situation, and I was out to find them.

Naturally, I applied for the biggest jobs in my area. Positions that no one would hire me for, and I wrote a speech. Yes that’s right, I wrote a speech, and studied common interview questions to build my speech into the interview process. I figured that if I could stand out immediately and appeal to businesses on an emotional level, then my credentials wouldn’t matter.

I was right. I went to my first job interview.  

We got to the third question: Why should we hire you?

I gave my little speech.

“After all my years in sales, there’s one golden rule that I’ve learned. Everyone is selling something. Whether its a product, a service, or hope for tomorrow. Everyone is selling something. And I’m going to sell myself to you today. My father and his father before him worked their fingers to the bone every day of their lives. They lived paycheck to paycheck, and they never knew if we were going to make it to next week, but they kept moving on towards a better future. They taught me to believe in myself, and treat others right, no matter what struggles you face. We’re all moving down that same road in life with problems along the way, and I want something I can really sink my teeth into. Most people don’t know what’s waiting at the end of that road. I do. Now, I’m not claiming to be a psychic or to be able to tell the future, but I know exactly what’s waiting there for me:

\[I paused as the extremely rich guy across from me opened his eyes wide\]

“Alright, tell me what’s there.”

Success. That’s what’s waiting for me. I see it clear as day, and I know where I’m going. I’d like you to consider me for this position, but I can’t make you hire me. There’s only one thing in this room that I have complete control over.

“What do you control in this room?”

That door behind me.

There won’t be another person who walks through that door more determined and hungry than me.  

\-He stood up, shook my hand, and hired me on the spot. They’d already chosen their candidate out of the room full of people who applied. I was the least qualified person in the entire building, but I got the job. I made them hire two people that day instead of one. I invested all of my money in education and special licensing for the position I’d gotten. I excelled in the office, made everyone jealous, and pissed off a multimillionaire regional manager in a couple of months (not on purpose, of course). It was incredible, but I had the same problems there that I had with every job. It was full of terrible, unreasonable, naysaying, negative people.

I started working remotely for my job because I was firmly against some of the practices of my coworkers, and it was allowed in my contract. I got stabbed in the back by a coworker while I was working in seclusion. The cards were stacked against me by that same, precious idiot. You’ll know you’re doing something right when the “crabs in the bucket” start pulling on you. My new car broke down. My resignation paperwork was turned in without my knowledge or consent, after the fact. At least 3 people conspired to get me out. Probably because I wasn’t Ivy league, and I wasn’t born to an upper-middle class family. People were stealing my ideas, and even quoting my work as if it were their own. It was surreal. I was just a simple street-smart guy. I had no idea that this actually happened outside of the movies. There was no difference in the type of people I found in the corporate world, and the type of people I grew up with in the worst part of town. Even Sun Tzu and Robert Greene couldn’t have prepared me for those two-faced sociopaths. Let me know if you can relate. I lost it all again.  

I was as nice as I could be to everyone around me. I didn’t let people walk on me, and I stuck to the moral route no matter how tough my road became. I was thrown under the bus for defending my friends against a racist nutcase. I was blackballed by the office for outshining their masters, and avoiding the endless drama (and gossip) coming out the office.

Copy writing had become my passion since my Papa passed away. Trading goods was his hobby. We ran a greenhouse when I was growing up, and we traded at all the flea markets in town while I was growing up. He taught me to talk to people from a young age, and It was always a big part of my life. I was inspired by great people like Frank Kern and John Reese. Guys who went through the same hardships that I faced. I’ve probably watched the John Reese interview with tony Robbins over a hundred or two hundred times by now. I had it saved on my laptop, and I watched it almost every single day. That guy went through some really tough days, and he made it out on top. If he could make it, then I could make it. I focused on coming up with those perfect words that would lead me further and further to success. I wrote the best sales script in town. I honed my skills to be the best sales agent in my league. I saw possibilities to do great things, and I knew it. I just needed the right words.

Early 2017- My childhood friend was stationed in Hawaii working for the Navy as a radio engineer. He spent a grand on a really crappy online course to learn how to make some kind of drop shipping site, or retail arbitrage business. He hated it, and told me to see if I could get anything out of it. I logged in, and learned how to make an awesome WordPress website from scratch. I wrote articles for my little website, and people loved it. Another friend joined in, and we made a few posts here and there. Just for kicks.

I think we made $10 on that little blog through Amazon affiliates. It was nothing, but It showed me what was possible. I shared my knowledge on sales, and communicating with others. It inspired a handful of people to reach out, and thank me for the great advice.  I loved writing speeches and sales scripts in my spare time. I read every copy writing book I could get my hands on out of pure curiosity.  

Then it hit me. I could write for other people, and I could help them find their perfect words.  

I started freelance writing for every business I came across. I got on reddit, and social media, and I made connections. My living wasn’t dependent on some paycheck that could be taken away without a moment’s notice. I didn’t have to worry about sociopaths nutcases trying to steal my destiny from me. Idea-stealing coworkers weren’t peaking around my desk or rummaging through my bookshelf. I could be just like John Reese. He was 117k in debt, and basically sold a winning lottery ticket for a thousand bucks. He had bought a domain name in the 90’s and transferred it for one grand. That guy sold the domain the same day for a million bucks. It’s completely destroyed him, and he spent three days locked in his room in the dark. He’d lost it all, just like me. I remember spending a few nights in the back of that old beat up van, with hobos knocking on my doors in a Walmart parking lot. The person I loved most in the whole world just got wheeled off in a hearse right in front of me. My relative stole everything from the family home and convinced the landlord that I was no good. I wouldn’t let them have my parents’ ashes, and it was all done out of spite. All I could do was look up at the dark ceiling in the back of that horrible van, listening to the homeless people scratching around at my doors. But I knew I’d get out of that dark room, just like john Reese got out of his. I could start my own business, cut out my own path against all odds, and work with people that are worth working with.

That’s where I am today. You could say I’m a writer, but it’s so much more to me than that. I get to help like-minded entrepreneurs reach the right people through their words. I spend my time looking for interesting clients to create value for. I focus on ad copy, blogs/articles, landing pages/websites, and product descriptions.  

To this day, every corner I turn around there’s someone negative. Every time I make a post like this, there’s those few hateful people who want to keep us all down. it’s the same in the office, the factory, the warehouse, the plant, and even at the bus stop.  

I think Richard Montanez (Multimillionaire CEO and creator of Flaming Hot Cheetos) explained it best:

\-No matter what room you are in, there’s always somebody there that will try to steal your destiny.

I’m not a victim. I don’t feel ashamed that I was from a poor family. I don’t regret standing up for what’s right, and I’m not going to let anyone steal my destiny. No matter how tough things get, or how great things become. These few experiences helped shape me into the person I am today. I hope this can inspire you the same way John Reese inspired me. Get up out of that dark room. You might not make a million dollar deal, but you can make a thousand dollar deal. You can make a hundred dollar deal. It might take a little longer to get there, but if you dream big, and think big, then your bound to make a difference in the world.  

I want to leave you on this one single thought that my Papa left me with:

What separates you from being the best that you can be?

Find an answer to that, and you’ll accomplish great things. I believe in you!

Merry Christmas!

P.S. If you feel inclined to do something positive, then go tell Frank Kern that him and his friend John inspired me to make it through the hardest points of my life. That’d be worth more than any other Christmas present in the whole world to me. God Bless!"

e95aum,44fn5a1b,"After 4 years of moving around a few times a year and running a fully remote business, I want to settle down somewhere","This post is about my overall experience and thoughts about living nomad life and how you actually can get sick of it.

It all started as a next freelance project when I had to fly to Moscow from Armenia (I'm from there) in order to meet with a client in person. That was my first business trip and I've been the first time in Moscow as well. The actual meeting went well, I got the project, but I decided to stay there for a while, I just felt that if it's possible to work from there why not? I didn't have a wife or kids, that's why there was no specific point of coming back to my home country in a hurry, so eventually, I stayed there for about 2 months. But when it got colder (in Moscow it does 🥶) I moved to Barcelona for a month, then to San Francisco, New York, etc... eventually, I ended up riding a motorcycle across all EU countries and getting experiences that I'll remember my entire life.

Now after more than 4 years of moving around, it's just not giving that amazing feeling of working anywhere I want, I started to love more places which are designed specifically for me, like a custom working desk, room environment friends, family gatherings, etc... So I've decided to settle down for a while and try to travel for vacations only.

I'm curious if someone also experienced this type of feeling when suddenly you are starting to feel an emotional connection to a single place only, and after traveling like crazy you just want to sit back and relax at your apartment, not an Airbnb room."

My sister is a traveler and she basically needs health insurance until the late summer, at which point her new employer will offer a plan. However, she can't get travelers insurance cuz if something serious happens, the job would be rescinded, so she needs a legit plan she can rely on but she is on the tightest of budgets. I've been trying to help her find a good option but even I'm a bit confused by it. She is moving from place to place at the moment so she needs worldwide coverage (not necessarily  incl USA). Can someone recommend a plan she can get for less than $200 a month (preferably closer to $100 if possible)? 

Also, can someone help me understand how they differentiate between inpatient and outpatient treatment? It seems like the coverage doesn't cover outpatient (you can add it for nearly double the price). Im not even sure I understand this--does that mean it doesn't cover doctors visits (I.e. To a doctors office for a checkup or whatev) only hospital stays in which the patient stays a night? Wouldn't it be cheaper for them to cover outpatient visits to a doctor then hospital stays? Anyhow, I need help finding her a respectable worldwide plan that will allow doctor visits since only covering a hospital stay doesn't sound right. 

Also, assuming the price was comparable, what do you think would be better--to get a better coverage plan (""gold or platinum) with a high deductible (several grand) or a low coverage plan (bronze) with a low deductible (between 0-a few hundred dollars or so)?

2. Full time role, incl. benefits (open to different employment structure if needed, but this is not part time / contract)
3. Strong proven and well documented sales process in place. Yes, you'll have room to improve it over time once you've nailed it - but this is not a ""figure out how to sell my startup"" role ; )

ea8ina,53dzmp8b,Where is a good base for digital nomads?,"Hi Digital Nomads! 

I wanted to ask all of your expert opinions. I’ve been traveling long-term for over a year, and while it’s been amazing, I’m feeling ready to have a “base” to call home for a while. 

What do you guys think are good locations for digital nomads? I know it’s a personal choice, but I’m seeking low cost of living, decent WiFi, and close proximity to nature, as well as traveling. Oh, and of course, some countries are easier than others to settle and stay a while, so that’s a factor as well.

I’ve spent a lot of time in Southeast Asia so I’m drawn to that region for cheap prices and easy travel, but I’m also interested in spending more time in the Himalayas, or possibly even exploring Eastern Europe. 

Thanks in advance for your opinions and suggestions!"

ealnps,2yveff7b,Hiring nomads in Asia,"Hey all - I’ve made a few posts about this and have had a lot of luck finding people to hire for my business. This time I need help in Asia - China specifically. 

My company, Krotz Services, LLC, performs audits on testing centers around the world. We audit flight schools in the US and professional licensure testing centers around the world. An example of these types of tests would include real estate exams. 

These audits take about 45 minutes - 1 hour and the pay is $125 per audit for the first 10 and $150 thereafter. I have to complete 75 audits in China this year and am looking to hire 2-3 subcontractors. 

This role does not require you to speak Mandarin or Cantonese, but you must be able to speak fluent English. 

The reason I am posting to this page is because I have found that nomads with more than 1 income are the most reliable travelers. The more reliant you become on 1 source of income, the more risk you take on. This job allows you to alleviate that risk and can generate some extra cashflow, but I do not think you would be able to solely rely on the work I have to offer as 75 x $150 is only $11,250 (not a full time income). 

Aside from China, I do need help in Southeast Asia as well. Please send me an email with your resume/CV if you are interested to dan@krotzservices.com 

Thanks!

eaq5jt,8ik2v,"Suggestions on mountain cities in Central America, South America, or western Europe","Hello!

I'm looking for some ideas of cities to visit next year in Central America, South America, or western Europe. I've got some somewhat specific requirements for what I'm looking for and I'm hoping this wonderful community can help me out.

Little background on me - I've been a DM for about a year, I'm U.S. based and I've mostly been traveling throughout the mountain region and western U.S. I'm planning to leave the U.S. next year but would like to stay somewhat close to EST, since I work EST hours.

Budget-wise I'm not too concerned, I've been in mostly MCOL cities in the U.S. and don't anticipate going anywhere more expensive than that.

I'm looking for cities that are outdoor-friendly with easily accessible rock climbing (preferably bouldering) and hiking. Ideally there would be a rock climbing gym as well. I'm generally a fan of smaller/medium sized cities (e.g. 100k - < 1mil pop), but I'm open to bigger places as well. I don't need a raging nightlife, but ideally I'd like to find places with some amount of culture/things to do and with good public transit. Good internet is a must. I only speak English, so I'd rather go somewhere where folks speak a little bit of English as well. I'm probably going to be changing locations every \~ 2 months. 

As an example, some places in the U.S. that met these requirements were Salt Lake City, Bend, and Boulder.

I talked with the remote year company about a 4 month package, but I KNOW it’s way overpriced. The main appeal to me is that they (supposedly) help you convince your boss to let you go. But I thought - why not ask people who’ve done it first? Maybe I can craft my own “presentation”. I certainly know I could make my own plans for waaaaay cheaper.

**So my question is to anyone who has done it - how did you get your work to let you become remote, if not permanently at least for months at a time?**

Also I have been historically bad at making friends quickly and am concerned about ending up isolated traveling alone. Even if I’ve traveled *to* somewhere alone, I typically have a friend already at the location. I’ve never been outgoing, rather someone who has few deep friendships that grew over time.

edjnb6,zv8bn,Thoughts from those that were originally too nervous to live overseas but finally went for it.,"I am in my early thirties, living in, and running a fairly successful business in the UK. I have wanted to experience life in another city for several years now (Hong Kong, LA, New York and some others), however I just can’t bring myself to do it...

Even though I don’t particularly like the UK, I am comfortable here. I have a great business, amazing family and friends, and having travelled dozens of times on business, staying in luxury hotels on my own (and getting lonely very quickly) I worry I’d get to a new city, be on my own, have nothing to do, and want to come home within days. 

Its a catch twenty two as I feel like experiencing life overseas is extremely important for personal development, and the younger you do it the better, yet I can’t bring myself to do it. 

(Just to clarify, I am extremely well travelled having been to many cities on holiday or on business trips, however that is different to spending some time living there)

I was wondering if there is anybody else who has been in a similar position; who thought about spending some time overseas for many years but never pulled the trigger... If/When you finally decided to do it, how did it compare to expectations? Was it a good or bad decision? Did you do it alone, or join a tour like Remote Year?

I know of many digital nomads that spent a huge amount of time travelling when they younger, which makes living overseas natural, but for somebody who has lived in the same city their whole life, the concept is scary."

egpvjx,,Thailand is disgusting,"I only came here because I was in Bali and my friends got a villa via Inspirato in Koh Samui. Out of the 25+ countries I've been to, Thailand is one of the dirtiest. From rats to people picking their disease-ridden feet in the streets, I don't know why this is a ""hot spot"" for nomads.

Fortunately, our apartment is very nice. We're in the business district and we have a pool on the 49th floor. There's a new mall nearby that's mostly clean, since it's underground. 

Most of the people here, the ones that interact with non-Thai people, are super friendly. 

But overall, I wouldn't recommend coming to Thailand. Even after a 15 minute walk on the street, your face is covered in soot. Combine that with the hot temperatures outside and freezing cold AC, and you've got the perfect recipe for getting sick."
egryq2,45rfz0p,Freelancer on Working Holiday in South Korea,"Hey there!
It's my first time posting here.

About myself:
I'm a trained translator from Germany, trying to work freelance and living in South Korea on working holiday visa right now. 

So I recently started freelancing on Upwork as a proofreader/translator, about 2 months ago. That's also roughly the same time when I came to Korea.

However, I got a job offer with a freelance agreement (doesn't pay much, but I always wanted to get into that company). It would be a full-time job but as a freelancer in customer service (40h/week). The company is based in Ireland btw.

My question now is would it be legal to work full-time on working holiday? I don't want to cause any trouble for doing something illegal involuntarily. But even on the German embassy's website it's so vague what the government would consider as ""work."" It basically says: ""as long as it doesn't affect the travel aspect of the WH visa."" 
I already saw that many people here said going to the embassy asking for those things is like a two-edged sword.

If anybody by chance has a similar story or knows somebody who went through that I'd appreciate every advice! 

Thanks a lot in advance."

For someone who has been to both of these cities, which did you prefer? And which is better suited for a digital nomad?

Which one is cheaper and which has better accommodation? Which has better things to do?

Right now the main disadvantage I see of Kuala Lumpur is the timezone difference because I would have to be up in the middle of the night to take sales calls for my business. But I think I can find ways to make it work, so if this city is better, then it’s no big deal.

Why would I use XOLO, insteado of opening the company in Estonia myself with e-Residency?

It seems these guys have more power than you over your own company... If they create the company for you, remotely, then they own the company, not you...! Or am I missing something?

One possible evidence that this is true, is gathered by looking at their pricing plan: https://www.xolo.io/compare

Just look where it says in the table ""Who owns the company?"".

How can I make sure that even with the ""Leap"" plan, I really own the company? XOLO owns the lawyers, the accountants, my info and the company's core info and the bank.

Why would one use XOLO on a real business? They can ruin your life overnight if they want.

However I'm not sure the best way for her to transfer money from a Chinese bank account to my US account (China is kind of a pain for moving money out in my past experience but I haven't been there in 10 years).

I have a PayPal link which she was able to send $1 to as a test, but then she tried to pay me $30 and it won't go through, some typical PayPal nonsense about how they suddenly don't believe her identity after all or whatever.  I see a lot of posts here in /r/digitalnomad about alternatives to PayPal such as Transferwise, so I'm trying to open an account there.  However I'm not totally understanding the process and it kind of sounds like there is no way for someone in China to pay Yuan directly into my Transferwise balance.

In a perfect world it sounds good to collect a bunch of certificates when just starting out. They really do make it feel like you’re getting some traction and getting somewhere.

&#x200B;

You may feel like this:

&#x200B;

But reality is more like this and you’re the one in the middle:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fw7mgnivw741.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff3caef6c401a2dec1b282fde932836162903d46

&#x200B;

I’m making this thread because I think this is important advice for newcomers.

&#x200B;

I was once at a point in my journey where I thought certifications would help me get what I wanted. I was desperate…

&#x200B;

Instead of doing the work I became a full time student and studied all this stuff that I could care less for, and have no desire to do for a living because I thought it would get get me a job. I took expensive classes from Stanford online in Python and Data Science. I got all the ZenDesk and FreshDesk certificates, all the Hubspot ones, all the SEM Rush and Google Adwords ones, the Bing Ads ones, and I even enrolled into a Harvard Business School Pre-MBA certificate, and took the proctored exam out of the Bangkok Business Building in Sukhumvit which I failed the first time around due to having weak quantitative skills, but passed it on the second try after a month or so of studying.

&#x200B;

I was unemployed because my previous employer had some weird issue with me living in Thailand and they let me go with a two week notice out of nowhere. This is another topic all together, but anyway I was living on savings and my Thai girlfriend was helping me survive. She had my back during this period and didn’t let me down and that helped a lot.

&#x200B;

This shit went on for awhile. I was under the illusion of progression, and my money was getting low. But I thought that all these certificates would help me get a position remotely in the near future so I could keep living the dream.

&#x200B;

And I was wrong…

&#x200B;

They weren’t worth anything. Months passed of me sending my “pretty” resume full of all these education “achievements” and nothing happened.

&#x200B;

It wasn’t until I snapped out of this way of thinking and  I started building projects on what I wanted to be known for, and re-writing my resume to reflect these projects that I really got some traction. I started cold emailing employers, cold calling, and doing all of the hard crap that you avoid when you just click the “submit” button and send out your resume. I used the projects I was working on as selling points to whatever skill I wanted to tie to my profile and raise the interest of the company looking to hire. This is what really started getting me interviews and giving me options.

&#x200B;

The best analogy that I could think of to reflect this mindset is that you want to start growing potatoes like Matt Damon had to do in The Martian.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5ixqxekpvw741.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3be1ef2ed865aa37d1f11e763ae2b7759a6fda5a

&#x200B;

If you haven’t watched that movie yet, watch it now because it might help you snap out of the mindset of consuming and collecting certificates, and put you on the path to becoming a problem solver which is a great way to becoming an asset to any company.

Once you have a small project under your belt, you won’t have any issues getting started anywhere. It makes it easier for you to sell yourself, and that’s all that the process of getting a remote job really is. It’s sales… find the type of job you want and start building small projects that relate to that type of position. The ""position"" or the ""type of job"" can be anything, those are variables which are not set. For example, If you want to be Python programmer, build a basic app via self education through free resources, then create a list of targets or potential remote employers and try to get in the door. You don't need to get in the door as Python programmer right away, just get in the door and change roles at a later point. Take support phone calls if that's what you got to do. If you want to be a copywriter or designer it's the same process. Just get in somewhere and take it from there.

I hope to be of help to you guys here.  Good luck and start growing those potatoes now.  That's how you move forward and get started."
ei4nxk,15nzfx,"My first year as a ""digital nomad"" (19yro) (15 countries)","I have been following this sub for over a year and have not posted yet, but thought I would go ahead and write a little about my first year as a digital nomad / traveling entrepreneur / traveler in general. I especially noticed that there were not many posts from people my age, so I am hoping maybe this could serve as some motivation for people who are in their teens and curious if it is possible.

In late December 2018 I took my first solo trip (I was just on break from college and finally old enough to buy my own plane tickets). I decided to spend 3 weeks in north India doing some charity work (and on the way back home (Florida) I did a long stop over in Qatar). I had always wondered if I would truly like traveling (especially to 3rd world countries) as  I had watched dozens of videos, but was curious if I would actually enjoy it as much as I thought I would. Even after getting horrible food poisoning I was hooked on the idea of long term travel.

I had been running online businesses since I was 15 and because of this I had strong savings and already could work remote and decided to give it a go.

In May I left on a backpacking trip to Europe that was a little over a month, I explored London UK, South Germany, All over Austria and a few small towns in Czech Republic and of course Prague. This trip even more so made me want to keep traveling. I managed to set up my next semester to be a study abroad semester in London, which was fantastic because the school I was at there had no attendance rules and many countries were a cheap $100 flight away (compared to the crazy flight costs in the United States).

I convinced the study abroad office at my school (somehow) to buy me a ticket to Bangladesh instead of a ticket to London and I would make my own way to London. So before my study abroad semester I got to spend 3 weeks traveling Bangladesh (All over the country) and then spent 2 weeks in Vietnam, a day in Singapore and a week in Thailand.

While studying abroad I visited Belgium, France, Spain, UAE (on a stopover if that counts?) and spent two weeks in Thailand.

I am now writing this from home as I wanted to see my family from Christmas, but now that I am done with school I have huge plans for 2020 for both business and travel. Already I have booked trips to London, Vietnam, Thailand, Bangladesh and Indonesia. I plan on traveling pretty much the whole year.

After traveling, three things I have learned / discovered that are worth sharing are:

1. Traveling can be ridiculously cheap (especially if you are good at making friends - free accommodation)
2. If you are from a first world country it is relatively easy to make a full time income online (freelancing, remote jobs and more basic online business models)
3. The world is a lot less scary than your family / friends might make you believe

I plan on posting a little more in 2020, just wanted to put this out there, partly for myself to reference in the future, and partly to maybe motivate someone my age to give travel a try.

eiarnv,al2op,A Guide to Remote Freelancing Through Larger Digital Agencies,"Hi all,

I'm a 23 year old remote freelance WordPress web designer. 95% of my work comes from the city I live in, in Ireland. I mostly build

* 'brochure' websites - three to five pages showing their products or services, contact & about page, no major functionality. Sometimes I do e-commerce, and custom sites with specific functionality,
* for local businesses - financial advisors, cafes, hair salons, retail stores, MMA gyms, bands, etc,
* using WordPress and the plugin Elementor,
* In the €800 to €2,500 price range.

I work with one other guy, 22, we split the work and profits about 50/50. In the middle of Jan 2020 I'll be moving to Thailand to live and work for 11 months, working remotely for my clients, and for three digital agencies in Ireland.

&#x200B;

# TL:DR;

If you are a digital freelancer working a skill that can be done remotely, and are prepared to work more hours per week than you currently get through your own direct work, reach out to other larger digital agencies and offer to provide your skill as a contractor through them. This is an excellent source of work, a great addition to your sales pipeline. You can learn a lot from working with larger companies, grow your network, and, of great importance to digital nomads, you can work remotely and still get clients from your home town/city..This has been working very well for us so far. Below, I'll explain how it works for us, give some advice, and look at the pros and cons of these arrangements.

&#x200B;

# What it works and how we do it:

I personally found it difficult to get work via cold phone calls and emails, and had more success with word of mouth spreading through doing great work, and by networking. But I wanted to grow my pool of clients faster/

So, on the advice of an older mentor, who ran a web design business with 10+ employees in the 2000's, I looked for work with other larger agencies in my city, offering to provide web design at an 'agency' rate. This is a lower rate than what I charge clients that come directly to me, so that the larger agency referring the work to me. The lower rate is for them to profit from getting the work, they also have sales staff to pay that get the work, and they handle onboarding and billing the client.

I now work for three larger agencies in my city. One has two staff, the 2nd has 4, and the 3rd has about 20+.The working arrangement with each is as follows: (*We =* My business partner & I, *the company* is the business contracting us to do the work, *the client* is the business paying the company to get the work done.)

* There's no anti-compete saying we can't work for other agencies
* We are allowed to do this work from abroad. They will handle the client, and if the client needs more than email communication from us, we can do a video and/or screenshare call via Zoom.
* We have an email address with each company, in the format [myname@thebusiness.com](mailto:myname@thebusiness.com)/ie
* We're not managed much and do most of the work ourselves, usually it goes like this:
   * The company finds a potential client and asks us for a quote and timeline estimate based on the current spec. The company marks up our quote, usually by 35 to 40%.

We (my biz partner and I) talk to the potential client over email, sometimes a video call, to gather more requirements. We have a custom online form they fill out to capture all details.

* If all parties are happy with the details - cost, time, etc - they are billed. Usually the company bills 50% of their fee, and pays 50% of our fee at the outset, then they bill the remaining when the project is finished and give us our remaining 50%.
* We then carry out most of the work ourselves, sometimes someone from the company providing the work will be making graphics, videos, writing content, etc other digital services, depends on the job.
* We work with the client to improve and finalise a V1 design, when we're both happy, the website is published, contracts signed off on, and the final 50% paid.
* The website is published by the company, not us, e.g. it says *Website by The Company*

&#x200B;

# Advice:

I think the above is a pretty good way to do it for a digital nomad, based on the fact that these three companies are happy to work off it. I've done at least two one for each of them and they have all gone very well.

* Find a mentor who will help you out. I've found most people, especially older ones, to be happy to share information with you. Even better if you can do some work for them, directly or for their clients do them, and pick up knowledge for lunch, shared trips for work, etc.
* Don't agree to not work for other agencies. The companies do all the competing and advertising for work, not you. IF they get it, you do it.
* Get paid 50% up front.
* Get the other 50% before a website goes live.
* Have high-speed internet, a good microphone, and good webcam for online calls. Use email wherever possible, then calls, as the former is quicker. I recommend Zoom for calls and Loom for making screenshare videos, as these are quicker for many types of communication for digital freelancers, e.g. critiquing a website.
* Have an efficient system for managing work, files, projects, ect. You need to be efficient and on-point, these people expect a high quality of work. It's much easier to switch contractor than it is to fire an employee.
* Charge well.
* Add padding hours/price to jobs, they'll almost always take longer than you estimate.

&#x200B;

All three of the companies previously had a web designer who had left, and I came in to take over existing sites and build new ones.

&#x200B;

# Pros and Cons:

There are pros and cons to this arrangement:

**Pros:**

* These three companies have all been around a good bit longer than us, maybe 8 to 20+ years. **They have a bigger and better reputation & network**, with brings with it **better reach and  flow of client**s. They are big *nodes* in our professional network that **feeds us work.**
* I have already spent 7 months living in Thailand, my business partner over 2 years (he's 22). We started working together at the start of my 7 month stint there. We found that **it is easy, in this type of remote digital work, to** ***work*** **abroad for** ***current*** **clients, but it's difficult to get** ***new*** **clients.** As much as the internet has come along, we found it easier & cheaper to find work in our local city. That seems to be the case for many of our competitors too, who are networking locally, meeting potential clients for meetings locally, and having a physical presence nearby - I've lost potential clients (leads) over the fact that they're older and self-admittedly '*from a time where you buy from people across from each other in the same room.* This arrangement is excellent because **these three companies have a local, physical presence where most of their clients and new clients come from.**
* One company has about 20+ employees. They bring in some corporate level work where we essentially charge more money than usual because they're corporate clients. At the start, I billed too low and had to be told to up the price. As well as paying more, these jobs give us experience with a new type of client; about 95% of our own work is with small to medium-sized businesses and start-ups.
* Another benefit of working with a company that has 20+ employees is we learn about how a larger business is run- my business partner and I are very interested in this kind of experience, and it will be a while before our own business is this large. It's an excellent learning opportunity.
* We learn to work as part of a larger team with the 20+ employee company; copy writers, graphic designers, etc.

&#x200B;

**Cons:**

* We earn a lower rate per hour. However, we're currently prepared to work more hours per week than we always get from our own direct work. If we were getting enough we wouldn't need these work arrangements. So it works out c:
* The work is published under the company we work for, by us. We're not strictly supposed to keep these items out of our own business website's portfolio, but we don't out of courtesy. We will mention such sites privately to potential clients though.

I'll make a new post in 6 to 12 months with what I've learned in this time :)

Happy to answer any questions y'all have about this arrangement :)

When I was younger I remember I've gone to Mexican Embassies in the US to request a transit visa - is this something that can be done over there? I.e., go to a Vietnamese Embassy in Japan to request a tourist visa a couple of weeks before entering?

I don't have any plans set in stone and I can't fathom having to gather all my visas before leaving, as most require dates, fixed entry and exit flights, and some even hotel reservations. 

Any guidance or suggestions would be absolutely welcome.

And while I'm here, do you guys use any reliable tool to know if you need a visa for a country, or is there a list of links per country to their visa information? My country has a visa list but it is a little outdated. 

Thank you."

ejzz31,12ra79,Over the FEIE Limit with W2 and 1099 Income along with Solo 401k,"I went from W2 employee to 1099 contractor in 2019. I already contributed the full 19k to my employer sponsored 401k before making the switch. 

I made about 70k in W2 income and about 110k in 1099. Because I meet the requirements for FEIE, I will be able to exclude the 100k (let's make the math easy) from income taxes. 

Now I know that this excluded money is not eligible for a 401k contribution, so I am really dealing with about 80k of leftover income. I am trying to figure out my ""employer match contribution"" to my solo 401k. The question is, can I take my employer match to be the ~20% of the 80k or is there some kind of prorating I have to do on this 80k with the FEIE amount (either by the dates that I am using to quality for FEIE along with when the money was source or by % of money or something else). Any advice on how the math works here would be very much appreciated. Thanks!"
ek0m8t,nzcdb,Really stressed about finding good clean affordable accommodation. Am I looking in the wrong places?,"I’m planning my first ever solo trip, I’m 23 and from Canada. For the first location I go to, I plan to stick around for a couple of weeks or maybe even a month or longer, so I want to stay in a single city for a while. 

I definitely don’t want to stay in a hostel because I want to have my own place so I can focus running my online business. 

I’ve narrowed down my first travel location to either Buenos Aires or Kuala Lumpur, both seem to be good for what I want, and I heard they have cheap accommodation.

Right now I’ve been trying to find accommodation on Airbnb but I’m struggling to find a clean affordable place with really high ratings. I don’t want to spend more than $800 USD per month on accommodation which averages to a max of $26/night. The biggest thing I care about with accommodation is that it is clean and doesn’t have insects crawling around or anything.

I constantly hear about people finding a cheap place/apartment in Southeast Asia or South America for just a few hundred dollars per month, but I can’t seem to find anything that is super nice like that on Airbnb for that cheap. 

Is Airbnb the right place to look? I could also look at hotels too but I imagine they would be more expensive, especially if staying for a couple of weeks or months. Do most of you people find affordable semi long-term accommodation on Airbnb or elsewhere? Where are some other places I can check?

Would appreciate some insight on finding a good clean place for a couple of week that is affordable!"
ek6778,ulrxz,Spanish-speaking cities with good cycling culture,"I'm a Canadian who works completely remote, and over the long winter seasons, I travel to warmer parts of the world with a bicycle packed up in a transport bag.

I'm currently in Medellin, Colombia, and while there is a decent local population of cyclists, I was hit by a motorcycle the second day I was in town, resulting in two wheels needing to be replaced (but thankfully no injuries). While Medellin has invested in some cycling infrastructure, the culture hasn't really adapted. That, along with the notoriously aggressive drivers here have really turned me off continuing to ride in the city. I've realized my worst fear, paying to transport my bike only to have it sit in my room while I walk and take Ubers. I'm eager to move on.

I would like to stick to Spanish-speaking cities so that I can continue to learn and practice the language. (Preferably in Central or South America, but I'm not opposed to checking out Europe)

In the video he speaks about the unexpected magnitude of isolation and loneliness he experienced, and also the stress that comes with trying to build and grow one's own business.

It seems to me as though the twelve months on the road have had a lasting effect on him mentally, and although he says he is not 'depressed', I got the feeling that he is still not back to the optimistic mental state he was in prior to departure.

As I approach twelve months on the road doing the DN thing, I find myself wondering how I will know it is time to settle on a single location and stay there.

ekkdfk,2xg70qs7,"Would it be wiser to renew American passport while in USA, OR just do it in Thailand?","My passport is running out of free pages. I'd like to leave America again in 2-3ish weeks. I will stay for 2 months in Thailand, then head to Europe. If I stay 2 months in Thailand, I may not be able to enter Europe or go anywhere else after Europe, depending on how they stamp my passport. 

It looks like it's possible to expedite the renewal here, however it will cost $238 to get it renewed within a week (according to FedEx site), which I just realized also says ""doesn't include government fee of $170."" So I guess that's $408 total minimum. 

According to the [American Consulate General](https://th.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/passports/adult-passport-renew/) in my intended first destination (Chiang Mai, Thailand), the cost is around $120. 

The downside to this option is it says the processing takes 2-3 weeks since the time they receive the mail, I'm not sure how long it'll take for the mail to arrive, etc. 

To do this I suppose I'd have to stay in Chiang Mai for at least 1 month. 

My only concern with that option is that even if I extend my 30-day Thai visa to 60 days as soon as I arrive, will I get my old passport back in time? 

It says that to expedite it they require ""proof of onward travel,"" which I have no problem providing, but what I don't understand is how can I book proof of onward travel if the passport expiration date will be different than what I listed on the airline ticket (effectively voiding the airline ticket, right?). 

I MUST renew my passport before or during Thailand, as I will certainly run out of stamps by the time I get to Europe. 

In short, what is the best option here: spend more and renew in America (and potentially wait longer to leave America), OR is it okay to do it in Thailand? Does anyone have experience renewing passport abroad?"

I read here so much about isolation and loneliness. About how the DN life is over hyped. Tell me your story about connection. Volunteering. Local meetups (Meetup.com, local equivalents).

en6dra,hgi15l7,What tools you recommend for going paperless?,"Always travelling ✈️ and having all documents in my phone is challenging. After several years and trying out most of the tools out there like Expensify, Shoeboxed, Rossum ai, receipt bank, and other receipt scanner like Scanbot / Google Drive I‘ll keep going on with Veryfi. (Shitty name they use). 

1.) Veryfi (handles also gdrive). Accuracy good. Works with EU invoices also. Tax OCR works sometimes. ML/AI recognition of Merchant. Fully custom category possible (Accounting). Timesheet workhour GPS logging. Superfast around 3-5 sec per Invoice/Receipt. No scanbot needed. I do use scanbot for Paper contracts etc. Has virtual Mailforwarder. Merchant recognition with Logo if known. Nice stats and budget feature. 

2.) Expensify with Scanbot (Pro: High accuracy, shady Outsourcing business). No VAT recognition. 10min up to 1h per Invoice. (Manual entry?). Going paperless only works if you also install Scanbot. Expensify has also a virtual mailforwarder. Pro: Lots of rulebased settings possible. They offer also their own credit card. 

My favourite scan logic for handling incoming paper invoices, receipts and mail payment confirmation is:

If: Invoice is Paper and smaller than A4 Sheet. Then use Veryfi iPhone App. Spend 15 sec for proper category / vat and price veryfication. 

If: Invoice is an Email with : matching rules (for e.g. paypal „Your paypal payment for....“ forward this to your.customail@veryfi.cc 

If: Received A4 paperstuff with 1 or more pages and is NOT an INVOICE then use Scanbot with Clouddrive with PDF/A OCR. 

Pro of that setup: 
- You‘re able to find any documents for example with a Clouddrive within seconds. 
- You even will find PDF/A Documents within Google Drive. With Onedrive such smooth PDF/A isnt working yet.
- All documents on Mobile/Laptop/Tablet in Sync.
- Clean „desk“ and less papers
- Easy export as CSV,XLS 
- 70-80% Of bookkeeping already prepared
- Smaller accountant costs
- Saving time against manual entry
- Full Text search over all your invoices AND contracts/generic paper
- Instant control over your budget (stats)

And if youre not fan of Gdrive then just go on with using /r/degoogle  😝. Maybe my post helps someone!"

More recently however, I’ve considered leaving behind the 9-5 completely (I’m a marketing strategist with 15 years experience brand side and agency side) and focusing on freelance work and living a full-time nomadic lifestyle.

I’ve noticed that a lot of digital nomads are devs (web, app, etc), content creators or social media managers - i.e work that is perfectly suitable to living and working remotely and is also in high-demand.

Are there many nomads out there doing marketing and brand strategy work, digital transformation consulting, media strategy work on a remote basis? Or have you varied your ‘toolkit’ to focus on work that is more suitable to being on the road without ‘face to face’ consulting required?

This kind of work just seems to be so face to face that I can’t imagine it being easy to pick up clients as you travel around remote locations. (For example, I’d be pretty good at picking up clients in developed, English speaking markets, but it’s going to be a tough market in Thailand, for example,

But as a DN, Im working around a set schedule with the necessity for energy management. I realize that I have to say no to new people i connect with and miss some fun events that might be happening.  

It gives me FOMO for sure, and almost makes me feel lonely...? Im just getting started on my trip though, so ill have a plenty of time to adjust. But it's just a subtle difference that i didnt expect to feel. 

Has anyone felt something similar?"

One month, cost of living, pros & cons, film","Last year I spent more than a month living in Montreal, Canada so  I want to show you what is to stay in a coliving with other travelers, eat local food like poutine, and visit the most important places of the city. 

Here's the complete guide and video: [https://sergiosa.la/city/montreal](https://sergiosa.la/city/montreal)

# Pros

* **Transportation** \- It's so much fun to move around this city as you have many options: metro, bikes, scooters even car sharing. I was mostly biking with a monthly rent that take the bike anywhere around the city. Also I use the electric bike as much as possible, and it helped to overcome the uphill roads.
* **Vibrant city** \- Especially in summer, everyone is happy to be outside. There are so many events to attend, parks to chill and activities to do. It's just so much joy around the city.
* **Cultural diversity** \- Overall there is great acceptance of any kind of cultural, racial and orientation choices therefore there is tons of great options on food, events and communities.

# Cons

* **Winter** \- This is the main issue of this city, as this season takes half of the year and it's freaking cold. I mean temperatures of -35º C (or 95 F) along with snow storms. This is why most people are happy spending time in summer and everyone either leave the city or just stay indoors.
* **French language** \- As the city is located in the french area of Canada, what's called the Quebec province, most of the people speak their language which makes it hard sometimes to connect with local. Either way most of them do speak both english and french.
* **City infrastructure** \- Now this is one is just to find more downside but it’s not that bad. The thing is, as the city grows there’s always construction all around which makes it, sometimes, annoy to walk or traffic gets jammed."

I’ve been looking into month-long retreats with other remote workers / digital nomads because it seems like a great way to experience a new place while also networking with like-minded people and staying focused on work.

Right now I’m looking at WiFi Tribe and potentially doing Buenos Aires and/or Seoul with them.

Any thoughts on these experiences? Did you find it fun/valuable? Any downsides I should be considering?

I don’t need to come out of the experience with new clients or anything, just looking for like-minded new friends and collaborators and memorable experiences."
eqctn8,1zav66f,We surveyed 331 remote workers and here's what we learnt,"Hey everyone!

We are super passionate about remote work and love interacting with other remote workers and digital nomads. So we reached out to remote workers from InVision, ScrapingHub, FlexJobs, Doist, GitLab as well as independent professionals and DNs. A lot of our assumptions were validated through the process while there a few surprises that popped up!

**82% said no plans to return to an in-office setting** 

Irrespective of the reason to explore remote work, this reflects the convenience it offers to individuals and how offering remote working opportunities might immediately make a company much more favourable to applicants.

https://preview.redd.it/cp4gapjgmhb41.png?width=1301&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c1b6dd161aec8ec8e2f37ba2ddd9c92ea2b6447

**Everyone would recommend remote work to others!** 

However, 35% said they would do so depending on the person they were recommending it to. This underlines the importance that remote working might not be for everyone or for every situation.

https://preview.redd.it/7xz6w1lgmhb41.png?width=1301&format=png&auto=webp&s=48613b44eaceed9df356544865bf6e096b429dc8

**Flexibility is the biggest motivator to work remotely** 

\>> Offering flexible work hours might improve retention & employee happiness. 

In contrast to the popular depiction of remote work being pursued by those with ""wanderlust"", only 8% selected travelling as their motivator.

https://preview.redd.it/ynn6eglgmhb41.png?width=1301&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0e3c142f6f424a722df44be3db5c2238f4d775b

**Battling work-life balance & loneliness remains tough** 

Other stated challenges: 

\- Managing work & communicating across timezones (17%) 

\- Infrastructure (8%) 

\- Personal productivity (8%) 

\- Comprehending one's company's culture (3%)

https://preview.redd.it/ne6mkzkgmhb41.png?width=1302&format=png&auto=webp&s=82e719e1674a9da44813f11c42975cfca4b221c4

**Even with the growth in co-working spaces, remote workers choose to work from home** 

Working from home at a whopping 84% in totality!  

63% say they have a dedicated home office.   

That helps in:  

\- Productivity  

\- Posture  

\- Distinction between work space & personal space

https://preview.redd.it/zc9zczkgmhb41.png?width=1301&format=png&auto=webp&s=6caa7d0f84e810e793113944caa283413cacf290

**Remote work doesn't mean employees are not working, but probably working too much** 

Our survey indicated that remote workers are probably working higher than the usual amount - a large part of our respondents (44%) indicated that they work for greater than 40 hours a week.

https://preview.redd.it/fh3rugkgmhb41.png?width=1301&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e5fada32e7156c3c93a75540584eb974f6e700d

**Dedicated slack for interests has been the easiest & best method to build good personal bonds**

Forming strong relationships in a remote team is tough given many conversations revolve around work at hand. So, you need to be intentional to create opportunities for such interactions.

https://preview.redd.it/g66h7zkgmhb41.png?width=1301&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fcb7e92e40c7f0e473572d742ee673cc463ebff

**Companies are slowly recognising that having a 100% remote company is better than partially remote teams** 

 Additionally, to aid remote workers in building a healthy and reliable workspace, 52% of respondents shared that their companies have begun to fund better infrastructure.

https://preview.redd.it/ka1hd2lgmhb41.png?width=1301&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a0809a02a1fedf9f2f6d5e39efb9e63d0bcdab6

eqslj8,5ce47o2w,Payment Processors for offshore bank accounts?,"Hi happy 2020 everyone!

I have read more than a few posts here of ppl saying that payment processors won't touch a bank account located somewhere such as Seychelles. That makes sense but I also wonder if it's not the standard advice shoved down our throats by the established order who don't like offshore banking.

I did a google search and found mixed results. A freedomsurfer article claiming it might be possible but it's either a lot of red tape or you get ""ripped off"" (without much specifics). A service calling themselves highriskgateways that tries to make it seem so easy but makes me feel like THEY are the high risk bet on my financial security (and fees that exceed any tax benefits). Another service calling themselves pay-world with a UK domain (not sure if I should be posting links) that sounds more reputable yet whose discount rate is too good to be true, at least from the perspective of having always been hunting for US based processors before now. Those are just the top search results of course.

The business in question is online and takes its payments mostly via credit card (and is not ""high risk""). The ideal solution is paying a reputable agent in somewhere such as Seychelles to have a company and bank account established with a merchant account that isn't going to sneak away with anyone's money. I just don't know who to believe as to the feasibility of such a thing.

Help me, digital nomads!"
eqv9n3,12nwwb,one-off garment washing strategy?,"Have you found a good one-off garment washing strategy while traveling?  On my last trip I needed to wash my Nike DriFit ballcap after a long 4 hour bike ride.  I also needed to wash a thin long sleeve base layer after one of the smelliest Uber rides ever in London.

I ran both under hot water, wrung them out and then hung them out to dry. The ballcap was better but not great.  The shirt was probably a bit better but still not wearable.  I use the following flip top bottle for my shampoo and conditioner:

er7ojj,3czpown3,So I attended the Nomad Summit in Chiang Mai...,"The workshops are going on today, I'm not personally interested in them, so I'm at my usual cafe on my laptop here in Chiang Mai.

This was not only the first Nomad Summit I have ever attended, it was the first 'conference' like this of any kind that I have attended.

I quit my 'real' job in January of last year, and have been doing the digital nomad thing, earning money online and traveling ever since.

My logic was that if I could survive for twelve months as a so-called 'digital nomad', then the Nomad Summit would be my reward at the end of the first twelve months.

Also I wanted to see for myself what kind of people attend, what the presenters have to say, and so forth.

The truth is that I was skeptical to the point of cynicism. 

I was expecting to dislike the presenters and a large bulk of the attendees.

Why? Because I think the 'digital nomad' subculture is mostly an illusion. 

There are heaps of remote workers out there, plenty of people making money online and living abroad.

There are also plenty of people traveling the world and not making much (if any) money online.

But people earning money online and traveling around the world, moving every few months (or even weeks)?

No, there are not that many of these people out there, and nor should there be: for the vast majority of human beings this is simply a terrible way to exist.

No regular friends, no regular clubs, no regular community? 

Some people are suited for this, the vast, vast majority are not.

Anyhow, I survived the first year, so I booked my flight to Chiang Mai and bought my ticket for the Summit.

I went to the pre-event mixer on Friday, the main presentation day on Saturday, the afterparty on Saturday night, and the pool party on Sunday (i.e. yesterday).

My overall assessment?

I was wrong. 

The speakers were better than I expected, the attendees were cooler than I expected.

Was it perfect? No. Were there a few unlikable people there? Of course.

But people were having fun, they were networking, some were gaining inspiration, maybe some of them were even making friends.

My hope is that by posting this thread, those of you who have attended a Nomad Summit in the past will leave your own thoughts.

And those of you who have not attended a Nomad Summit previously will consider doing so in the future.

Cheers."

erltlh,5299wu3c,Why is teaching English abroad a good first step in becoming a digital nomad?,"I don't know how many people have taught English abroad before.

Maybe you want to be a digital nomad but don't know where to start.

Anyway, here is my story of how teaching English abroad led to me eventually being able to comfortably travel on my own money.

Before I taught English abroad, I was an unemployed college graduate with student loan debt. I was only able to get part-time or seasonal jobs. The money wasn't enough to be fully financially independent.

I remember at that time thinking about doing something like freelance writing or freelance programming. But I wasn't experienced in those things. Also, I remembered writing gigs paid very low wages. I recall it was ten dollars for ten articles.

Then I took a job as a part-time English teacher in a Korean elementary school out in the countryside. Living standards were cheaper than in America so I was able to save more money. The pay wasn't the best but it was a good start.

Also, it was my first experience living in a foreign country by myself and I came in through a program so I had help in transitioning to the new life.

What I am saying is that if you're nervous or indecisive about being a digital nomad, perhaps you can try getting in through one of those programs (government or recruiter sponsored) for teaching English.

Usually, the requirements are easy to meet so it's a good choice for inexperienced people who don't yet have much to offer to the marketplace.

Finally, these jobs tend to be part-time rather than long 40-hour workweeks so you have more time to learn a skill that can help you later in life.

You will have time to develop a new skill while having a steady paycheck each month. At the same time, you meet new people and learn about new cultures."

I'm not opposed to getting a remote job to work more as well, currently working a digital marketing/SEO internship while in school. I'm also into FIRE which helps a lot with building up savings/investments.

I'm at a point where I have no obligations, ie: young, no kids, no gf. The previous relationship ended a little less than a year ago. Looking for new opportunities to live free and meet likeminded people living the ""alternative lifestyle"" popular in this subreddit and YouTube.

I've considered Van Life, Bali, Chiang Mai... I see that there's more of a consistent community in the more stationary lifestyle in the cities versus hopping around in a van (at least from my research). Are there any places in the US that have a strong digital nomad community? I like the idea of being closer to friends and family from home, but I'm open to anything tbh.

The typical path could be to buy a house (interested in RE investing) and get a traditional job living back home in central Florida. Taxes are low and there's strong growth, I just feel like at this point in my life I might as well be adventurous and try something new. I could always get a property manager and still invest in real estate back home later when I'm more established and live somewhere else part of the year.

I'm used to having at least two large screens (if not four), either in a office setup or at home.

Every time I have to use a laptop screen on it's own, I get frustrated.

Obviously lugging around screens isn't an option, so do you guys just work from laptops all the time? or something else?"

evwsxi,4ulgb,phone and data during long-term travel,"I'm getting an s10 and trying to decide between single or dual sim. I will be gone for a year (mostly Africa, Russia and India). My plan is to port my number to Google voice, use local data plans or T-Mobile for data , then use that data to use Google voice VoIP for voice/SMS.

From the perspective of people back in the U.S., will it be as if nothing changed (since I'll have my same number)?

What are the limitations in my plans? Is there any benefit for a dual sim in my situation?

Thanks all!"

ewcq15,14oq6u,3 Italian accredited accountants contradicting eachother on Growth Decree social security contribution (14k eu discrepancy !),"Hi All,  
The ""Growth Decree"", Law n. 58, June 28, 2019 (see link below) stipulates that, under certain conditions (not having lived in Italy before, etc) you'll only get taxed on 30% (even only 10% in south italy) of your income (as a freelancer) if you set up a new business as a new resident in the country.

That part - everyone agrees on.  
It's the part about the social security where I got two contradicting opinions and both made by professionals.

One says that social security will be calculated on 100% of the income, the other one says that social security is calculated on the taxable income, therefore it is only calculated on 30% of the income , under the growth decree.

When I confronted him the the accountant that states 100% is taxable he replied:  
That is not accurate, as social security rate is calculated on taxable income and not on the entire (100%)  income. So let's assume that your freelance business has a 80k turnover this year, your social security will be 27% of 30% of 80000 and not 27% of 80000.

No clue who to believe.

ewfn8k,1zfyi7gx,Considering traveling through the US (With a dog) - any location recommendations?,"Hey all,

&#x200B;

My lease is ending soon and I'm thinking through what I want to do next. I work fully remote and have the support of my company to travel/ move wherever I want. Has anyone done short term stays/ travels through the US while working remotely? Most of the posts I see are abroad, so if anyone knows some cool US spots your input would definitely be appreciated! The only real sticking point is I'd probably need locations that are fairly dog friendly, which I'm guessing might limit me a bit.

&#x200B;

Thanks!"
ewoouz,177n71,"Options to stay in the USA a few years, visa runs possible?","Im guessing no.. and have seen online a rule of thumb that you need to spend as long in as out of the USA.

Anybody do it? 

Im from Australia, we do have a half greencard a E3 Visa - for Australian Citizens to Work in the USA. But that would mean getting a job.. I could probably without too much trouble get a job but its not really my thing.

I do run an Australian business and have done this for 6 years now, selling a self developed hardware/software product. Dont have the cash to do a biz investment visa, im pretty much broke but have decent cash flow.

A USA 6 month business visa? Can you visa run them?  
I do work on upwork and earn small money from Youtube, I spose that is employment that puts me foul of the business visa requirments?..

Long term GF has a Green Card to go work nursing in NY, we will marry at some stage soon anyway so yeah how does that change things?

lol lots of high end questions! wheres a better place to ask maybe?

I have been visa running for 10 years now! no country for more than 90 days."
