ewzgqy,4fahkrek,Resentment from non-remote coworkers?,"Hi I’m slowly working towards my dream of becoming a digital nomad. I’m starting with remote days and even did a remote month last year. 

Everywhere I’ve worked where I’ve taken remote days (where management has 100%) approved them and I’ve had no issues with my performance, I always notice there’s a colleague or 2 that goes extra hard criticizing my work. I’ve also had coworkers say they’re “salty” about the fact that I’m working remotely. Or I hear people talk about the joys of being in the office and how you can’t ever be productive working remotely.

Have any of you experienced this? Advice for pushing through this? 

Note: I’ve only ever worked at brick and mortar companies with a few remote workers max and generous remote days."

ex9xwi,4b18oqip,What's your traveling pattern?,"My GF and me typically travel with itinerary like this:

- B1 (base point, 1-6 months)
- T1 (a transit point, 1-7 days)
- I1 (interesting place in the region to visit, around a week)
- T2 (another transit point, 1-7 days)
- B2 (next base point)

And then repeat. Overall it's longer term stays intertwined by short-term touristy visits, with transit stops added to relax and maybe save money. How long we stay in transit points often depends on when the tickets are the cheapest. Of course, sometimes transit stops are interesting on their own, then we can stay there for a bit longer.

For base points, we typically find an apartment and make sure it has internet, kitchen, at least 2 rooms etc. For short term stays, a private room in a hostel or airbnb is just good enough, as long as it has WiFi and a desk somewhere.

So does everybody travel like this? I'm thinking what would be a perfect nomad accommodation for shorter stays, e.g. transit points and touristy visits. So I'm curious what are your itineraries like (and maybe what you want the most from accommodation except WiFi)."

exih2i,zd389,US Physical Presence Test Question,"Is anyone here familiar with the ins and outs of the IRS code concerning the Physical Presence Test?  This is what I read on the law from their website:

>You meet the physical presence test if you are physically present in a foreign country or countries 330 full days during a period of 12 consecutive months. The 330 days don’t have to be consecutive. Any U.S. citizen or resident alien can use the physical presence test to qualify for the exclusions and the deduction.  
>  
>The physical presence test is based only on how long you stay in a foreign country or countries. This test doesn’t depend on the kind of residence you establish, your intentions about returning, or the nature and purpose of your stay abroad.

I know it is primarily related to the Foreign Tax Deduction, but I'm more interested in the opposite side of the coin.

Not sure if I'm understanding this correctly... but let's say I take the leap and become a DN and work abroad \~10 or so months a year while spending approx. 35-40+ days in a 12-month block at my current US residence... I would therefore be still considered a full fledged US resident and there would be no issues with me keeping my current W-2 job taxable at my current US residency even if I spend the majority working elsewhere? All my work would be for a US company with US clients.

The only thing preventing me from taking the leap is my bosses logistical questions of residency/taxes as we're a small business that uses a 3rd party payroll provider.

Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!"

eyb1tn,dymtj,Places in South America/Mexico similar to Krabi/Ko Lanta in Thailand?,"This maybe a weird question but I was in Thailand recently and LOVED IT. The beaches, the people, the food, the price, the accommodations, the weather, I loved it all. 

I would live and work from Thailand in a heartbeat but the time difference is too much for me at the moment (all of my work and meetings are mainly EST).

Are there any beaches/cities in South America that are similar to Ko Lanta in Thailand? Similar vibes and affordability? Being in the same time zone as my coworkers and clients would be ideal.

Thanks in advance!"
eybd9s,w1g4i,"Budapest, Hungary","Budapest, Hungary.    Wait, wait. Here is my view of this place, my opinion, my personal experiences.   
Required picture of laptop, sitting with view of water of some sort.  This is a view of the Gellert hill on the Buda side, from Pest.    
https://i.imgur.com/rg73Gcl.jpg     
Very good LTE coverage almost all places in the country.  Some remote areas (in the unpopulated mountains where I hiked), or odd places (tunnels, deep gorges, valleys) the reception drops.   
WiFi is available from all chain restaurants, cafes and similar I have visited.    
 If you get a local or Eu SIM, many of the carriers offer WiFi hotspots throughout the country.    
(I did not get a local SIM, as I just used free WiFi everywhere.)    
       
&nbsp;
      
I often stopped at small bread, pastry shops, confectionery bakers in a tiny villages.  Almost all had some free WiFi.  
Cash is still king. The currency is Forint, although Euro is tolerated in most tourist areas.    
That said, Visa and Mastercard credit or debit cards are accepted in most restaurants and larger establishments, even in tiny villages.  Make sure you know your PIN, expect to sign for the card, and if your card does not have a chip, vendors might not accept it.  Leave your AmEx at home.  
       &nbsp;
      
Public transport in larger cities is dirt cheap.  A month pass in Budapest for unlimited bus, metro, trolley, some railway, boat, and some other stuff for 9500Ft or 29EU/32USD.  The pass is sold from automated kiosks, which do take visa and mc.   
       &nbsp;
      
Food is clean, most tap water is drinkable, although I would stick to bottled for westerners.   
I have done both AirBnB, and similar.  The cost can be as low as 180EUR/200USD for a place with kitchen, WiFi, washer & dryer, and right on the metro line.  When staying extended, I always look for outside of city center/tourist trap areas right on the metro line.  I was not staying long this time, so I was using some points in a hotel.   
       &nbsp;
      
Safety - At no time did I feel threatened or worried in the city, but all big cities have bad neighborhoods.  Petty thefts do happen, specially during rush hours on busy public transports.  Remove your backpack and hold on to your pockets.      
Medical, dental & eye services are on par with expected Western services and various insurances are accepted.  The cost is lower than in Western Eu or USA.  I have met a few foreigners (German & USA) who came to Budapest for dental work (implants), paid cash and said they saved over 50%.     
       &nbsp;
      
IT jobs are figuratively around every corner, specially if you have security related experience.  Foreign language teachers (English, German, Chinese) are also in need, it seems.  If you are EU, EAA no need for permits.  If from elsewhere, I think you need EU blue card.   A westerner working for a western company in Hungary is rich.  I have lived off of 480EUR/500USD per month (not including room) and ate out almost every day, had my clothing laundered, traveled the country, had house cleaner and such.   
       &nbsp;
      
A lot of cultural, foodie, wine, hiking, outdoorsy stuff to do.  Best part? I was able to get to nearly any of these places with public transport within a few hours even for the furthest places.    
     &nbsp;
       
      

The negatives - smoking is still very heavy but rarely indoors.  Public bathrooms almost always cost 100Ft or more.  Have coins. Winter weather can get gloomy (see picture) for weeks.  A/C in small villages are still treated as evil (open window when A/C is running?!?).  Winter time, everything is heated to 23C/74F, melting my face off (kept turning off heat in my place but cleaning lady kept cranking it back up).     
       &nbsp;
      

So, to recap, fast internet, good safety, good public transport, good nightlife (albeit I rarely sampled it), friendly, affordable, most cities and towns are walkable, speakers of English and German can be always found, jobs can be had.       
       &nbsp;

Being a DN is satisfying to me and I'm happier when I don't feel tied down, but I keep feeling like I'm doing my future self a disservice. I've tried to find ways to make more and save more.

ezxnh1,3kijt,"Just did a bunch of research on portable monitors, and thought I'd share.","I'm planning to become a digital nomad in April. One of the things I like least about working from my laptop is the  lack of screen real estate. Apparently portable laptop monitors have  come into their own in the last year or so though, so I decided to do a  little research. Figured you might be interested in my findings.

My  laptop is 15 inches, and I'd like something a little larger, so I'm  looking for a 17.3 inch monitor (even though having a second 15 inch  might be significantly easier to travel with, since it fits in my laptop  bag). The 1080p monitor on my laptop feels a bit cramped compared to my  4k desktop, so I wanted to find a happy medium with 1440p. 17 inch at  1440p means I'll probably use the secondary monitor as my primary  monitor when I have a desk available, so that's a significant improvement. Finally I'm kinda a fiend for refresh rate, so I was  looking for something at 120 or 144 hz.

That's a tall order, but it looks like one brand actually delivers what I'm looking for:

[https://www.amazon.com/Eleduino-Portable-Resolution-Anti-Glare-Brightness/dp/B07ZPMYJRM/ref=sr\_1\_3?keywords=17+inch+144hz+1440p+portable&qid=1581013933&sr=8-3](https://www.amazon.com/Eleduino-Portable-Resolution-Anti-Glare-Brightness/dp/B07ZPMYJRM/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=17+inch+144hz+1440p+portable&qid=1581013933&sr=8-3)

At \~1 cm thick and 2 pounds, it's a pretty reasonable thing to fit in luggage. Even 2 of them would be reasonable.

But  who the heck has ever heard of Eleduino, and why are they selling  monitors that are branded ""MageDok"" (and who the heck has ever heard of  MageDok)? I'm probably getting scammed and will have to return it to  Amazon. So I'm playing it safe and also preordering an ASUS ROG monitor  that I'm pretty sure is going to be the best of the best when it comes  out February 24th:

[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0845Y1FRN/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o00\_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0845Y1FRN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

That  one's only 1080p, but it checks all the other boxes, is lighter, and is  from the most trustworthy brand in the portable monitor space. Some  part of me is also giddy at the idea of having 3 monitors while  traveling. We'll see.

I also briefly considered the UPERFECT 4k monitors, but there isn't a single review online, and they don't even have model numbers, so it  feels like a big roulette on what you're gonna get. If neither the  Eleduino or the ROG deliver, I'll probably roll the dice on a UPERFECT  4k at 60hz.

Pretty much everything else I looked at fell in my ""Do Not Buy"" category, with the exception of the G-Story line. Those monitors seem to be competitive, but at 4 inches thick, they're going to take up a lot more of my luggage than I'd like. If you're looking for a 15 inch, there are a lot more options, but none stand out compared to the links above. Particularly if the goal is to beat the monitor that's already on your 15 or 17 inch laptop."

f0dsz2,yjo9q,"Lowering Nomading Housing Costs With 'Extreme' or 'Unconventional' Tactics? Van Dwelling, House Sitting, Work Exchanging, Geo-Arbitraging, Something Else?","We're always on the lookout to optimize our money (savings/investments/expenses/etc.) but eventually hit a 'wall' with reducing housing costs, arguably one's biggest recurring monthly expense. We had managed to get our housing costs down to $450 for a one bedroom apartment, but couldn't really get much lower without drastically impacting quality of life.

So, we started to look for creative ways on how we could further cut our housing costs, travel, DN, and have a similar quality of life. From house sitting, and RV'ing, to work exchanges, volunteering, and travel hacking nothing was off the table. We eventually settled on house sitting as the best 'fit' for us and in our first year of pursuing FI/RE (r/leanfire) and concurrent long-term travel/DNing, we completed 18 house sits and found that we very much enjoyed it. It lets us travel, see new places, live like a local, meet great families, and take care of pets with varying personalities that we get to play with, pet, and love.

Fast forward to the present and we’ve been on the road for three years (four continents, 26 countries, and 80 cities) all while having the pleasure of doing nearly 60 house sits.

The costs savings, as we suspected, can be phenomenal (and spill over to more than just housing/lodging).  In 2019 we had to 'cover' lodging for 10 nights outside of house sitting (nine Airbnb's and one hotel award). For perspective our **total 2019 housing/lodging costs** were $293.38, and that includes 'living' in places like Alexandria, Philadelphia, Chicago, Atlanta, and a few months in New York City.

With that being said, it's not all rainbows and butterflies! House sitting can come with its fair share of challenges and work. Although, some will have you believe ***it's free lodging OMG!*** it’s way more involved than simply ‘*a free place to sleep while traveling*’ (it’s not a hotel or Airbnb after all), you need to weigh the pros, cons, amenities, etc. of every house sit and choose wisely. 

To clarify, we would never fool ourselves into thinking we've already hit FI/RE, are going to hit it sooner, or are artificially increasing our income simply because we're not paying a rent/mortgage/housing right now... again, that's not sustainable long term. We need to make sure our numbers will work in the worst of times and long term. In our opinions, the wise thing to do is to build into one's FI/RE projections plenty of margin for today, tomorrow, and 60+ years (for example) into the future. Also, we need to make sure that we're not limiting/hurting our income potential with this lifestyle. So far it seems that we're fortunate and it's not because we're mainly working with existing long term clients or with companies who already have a distributed work force. We've noticed that for the most part neither seem to mind where we are in the world, as long as we deliver, and in fact, our income has actually increased since we had an apartment.

We're curious, are others that are DNing (or planning to) applying 'extreme/unconventional' tactics to keep their housing budgets low? As DNs the classic example is of course geo-arbitrage, make USD's pay in Baht, Peso, etc., although that requires living in the developing world, which some DN's don't wan't to (or don't like the quality of life), or can't because of work restrictions.

Any lessons learned, mistakes to avoid, or tips for your specific housing/lodging hack while DNing?"

f16g34,xie0n8b,Please do not destroy your own reputation by constantly posting photos with a MacBook at the beach,"From my point of view, there is a difference between a Remote Worker and a Digital Nomad but one could probably argue about the definition. 

**Remote Worker** → employee at a company (just like any other employee without being tied to an office or location)

**Digital Nomad** → could be a Remote Worker, but most often is a freelancer or solopreneur/entrepreneur who runs their own business

I totally support the Remote Work movement. I think in many branches this will be the way to work for a big part of the workforce. I believe it will be a chance for many employers and employees. It will bring new challenges, but it will bring a lot of freedom and flexibility to employees and increase productivity and happiness.

Unfortunately, in Europe (as far as I know) this is not popular at all yet. I also understood that many people there have the wrong image of remote work. Obviously many still believe that work can only be done if sitting in the office (which we know is not true). However, if every other blogger in this niche posts photos with the laptop on the beach, pool, mountain, beach club, or even the road, how should we be taken seriously.  

**My suggestion: please spread the truth, which for a lot of people means working many hours every day in some co-working, cafe, or home without proper ergonomic equipment. Nobody actually works from the beach.**

f1b9nb,4wswk84l,Part-time living options that aren't cynical corporate bullshittery?,"Basically I need to be in London once a week for networking and to touch base with a few clients. The rest of the time I'm away from the UK.

So I'm looking at housing options. As we know, hotels are pricey and lonely, hostels are too precarious, Airbnb is the best bet so far but it's increasingly becoming an overpriced hot mess. What I want, and what I'm sure a lot of digital nomads like me (people who do need to keep one foot in a home base) want, is a place I can call ""home"", a simple, small room where I can keep a second laptop and a change of clothes, without having to shell out for a full month's rent on a room (in London, we're talking around £600 for a shitty box room that will be empty for three weeks a month).

So then I hear about this whole ""coliving"" ""movement"", which upon closer inspection, just seems to be a new property developer swindle. Thesw developments are aimed at ""digital nomads"" and basically give you a glossy dorm style room and come complete with coworking space and mingling opportunities, yadda yadda yadda. But not only do they close you in to this hyper homogenised and samey world (what's the idea? That you move seamlessly from New York to London to Tokyo to some Thai beach, sealed off from the outside world and meeting only other middle class thirty somethings like you?) they're also piss-takingly expensive. £1,500 for the privilege of staying in your corporate millennial farm pod? Are you for real mate?

Do you guys know the sort of place I'm talking about? What's your take on it?

And apart from that - anyone have any creative ideas for getting an affordable base in London that doesnt have me shelling out a full month's rent every time, and sees me able to leave some stuff on site so I dont have to keep hauling basics back and forth with me?

I was considering pairing up with someone on a similar situation to split a room rental."

f1ljse,nzcdb,How fast/slow should you travel to comfortably grow your online business at the same time?,"I run a social media agency and I have a couple of clients and I’m looking to start traveling soon for the first time (I’ve never really traveled much before). 

It seems like some digital nomads do very fast travel where they are always hopping around from city to city every few days and are always on the move. On the other side of the spectrum there are digital nomads who stay in a single location for a couple of weeks or even months on end. 

I want to be dedicating around 8 hours per day growing my business so it seems like with fast travel it would be hard to do that, but I’m still not too sure since I’ve never traveled before. 

So for anyone who has been growing their business (or even if you work a remote job that requires you to work 8 hours per day), what do you find is a reasonable pace of traveling? How long do you stay in one city or country for? Do you just get an Airbnb and stay for a couple of weeks or move around a lot?

My priority is growing my business, so that’s why I’m leaning toward traveling slowly and staying in each place for a decent amount of time."

I've been location agnostic since November 2017, but have had to take a break from traveling to spend time with my mum who was recently diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer. She'll be on treatment until September, but I'm going crazy here, have lost all productivity and motivation to work, and my mental health is in the toilet. Basically, I need to get back on the road (I'm English, but my folks live in France).

I've decided to go with convenience and to stay nearby, god forbid things take a bad turn and mum goes from 'on the mend' to 'death's door'... :( My choice is easy: Spain and Portugal.

I have also decided to do this trip via train and not plane for a couple of reasons:

1- as I'm getting older (27) I've become more and more conscious of the world around me, and how each small action impacts the world in a big way

2- I can smash out 12 hours of work in a train, whereas airports and planes are a bit of a muck-around for short hauls

&#x200B;

I have two options for starting points, as I'll either be leaving from Angers or Rennes in France.

Option 1: Angers/Rennes -> Bordeaux (a day or two max, maybe even just overnight) -> San Sebastian (1 month) -> La Coruna (a couple of weeks) -> Porto (1 month) -> Lisbon (2 to 3 months) -> Faro (hopefully the whole summer with a cheap deal :D)

Option 2: Angers/Rennes -> Paris (definitely for one night only, I will try to bypass this and do a full day on the trains rather than spend a night in this poophole of a city) -> Barcelona (not sure...) -> Valencia -> Small, quiet and relaxing locations heading south -> Alicante -> Madrid -> Lisbon/Porto/Faro

I've already done Sevilla and Malaga, and do not fancy returning, I'm looking for quiet, relaxation, and just getting work done and sleeping like a baby :) 

I'm looking for suggestions on either trip, suggestions on quiet areas to stay in any of the above locations, suggestions for other cities, and suggestions for other trips all together (was thinking of doing Bruxelles -> Germany -> Poland -> Latvia -> Estonia but the cold is putting me off haha!)

Hope to hear from some of you soon with your experience and suggestions!"

This has been a recent decision based on several factors and when I was interviewing I was not considering moving.

How should I approach this topic with my manager? I am only onboarding currently and they have no idea I want to move. Would it be too much to ask them if I can move cities within my first week on the job? Most of my team is on the east coast and the company's headquarters are on EST time.

Unfortunately, they hired too many in-house engineers and cut me loose. Been having a hell of a time finding more work - doesn't help that I don't have an engineering degree (Bachelors of Science in Chem and Bio).

I'm wondering if it's time to switch my focus to another career. 

Some background for those who like to read: I'm basically a home-brew engineer. Before getting certified in Solidworks, I was a working as a freelance rapid-prototyper out of my local makerspace. I learned how to do everything from 3D modeling/printing, CNC routing and laser cutting with basic welding, sheet metal fab, circuit design, and programming thrown in... all self-taught.

The problem is, I have zero desire to work full-time (I have plenty of my own projects to keep me busy) and I loooooooooooove the freedom of remote work. I don't need much money but I do need some. Maybe I ought to just learn how to code at a professional level? Thoughts? Am I barking up the wrong tree?"
f3l2bv,nzcdb,How do you plan out a trip and accommodation?,"I booked my first ever trip to Portugal (might go to Spain too) for the beginning of March. I plan to go at the minimum for 2-3 weeks but maybe even up to 4-6 weeks. 

Since this is my first trip, I’m struggling to plan things out. During the trip I plan to work on growing my business and exploring. I think I will spend the majority of the time in Lisbon.

I personally like the idea of not planning things too far in advance, but the issue is that the Airbnbs can start getting booked up so it kind of forces me to plan in advance where I’m going to be for each week of the trip. 

So you typically book a single Airbnb for multiple weeks or do you get a couple of different Airbnbs each for a few days or a week? The disadvantage of choosing one is that if I don’t end up liking that Airbnb or if it’s not in a good location, I would be stuck there. But at the same time it would kind of be a nightmare to book and deal with like 6-7 different Airbnbs in a single city. To further complicate it, if I go to other cities, that would make it even more complex to plan in advance. 

So I’m struggling to decide how to structure everything and how far in advance I should do it. Or should I just do everything spontaneously as it comes?

Any advice would be appreciated from someone who has experience traveling a lot."

Now I came across this new policy which seems very appealing, has anyone heard of it and do you know how it works? I have read the article but I'm not sure I understand everything. 
From what I've understood this is how it works. 

[Here is the Article](https://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/insight/publications/2019/05/italy-broadens-the-scope-of-the-special-tax) 

Example: 
- EU citizen moves to Sardinia and lives there 
- Works online for foreign clients by providing digital services 
- Makes €100,000 per year (for easier calculation) 
- 90% is tax exempt (€90,000) 
- 10% is taxable (€10,000) 
- Applicable tax rate on €10,000 is 23% (€2300) 
- This tax policy is applicable for the first 5 years 
- After 5 years, 50% remains tax exempt (€50,000) if the subject has had one child and bought a house 
- 50% of the income is taxable (€50,000) 
- Applicable tax rate on €50,000 is 38% (€19,000)

f4avgo,l440a,Open to Advice from Experienced DNs on Next Destination,"Background:

Did a year in SE Asia, not interested in going back (noise, jarring culture differences, coronavirus risk, social factors)Past year in Europe, but mostly Central and Eastern Europe - feeling played out on high corruption, culturally conservative and religious places (Poland was not my cup of tea, been in Belgrade for a bit, but noise and isolation in the city an issue - people are friendly here, but you cannot make friends with them... if that makes sense - nationalism and culture prohibitive to closer relationships, Poland was similar but at least had more expats)

Desires:

Somewhere in Western Europe - LOVE France, though have already spent time in Paris metro and Lyon, as well as some smaller towns in the north - happy to go back... love of my life is in the Paris burbs, complicated situation, not for this thread; Netherlands is also about my style, but cost of living may currently be prohibitive

Not a big city - Before moving abroad, I was in Vail, CO for many years, a small mountain town overrun by rich assholes and 3 million tourists per year - I left because of poor opportunities for career advancement and isolation; it's a fine line, but I'd like to be somewhere that isn't a giant metro, but has access to social opportunities - places with quieter neighborhoods or suburbs with access to cities I'll gladly consider  
Edit: Big cities are worth considering, in general, but see below...  Also depends on vibe (Amsterdam is chill outside the touristy center, so not so bad, but won't fit budget)

Outdoor opportunities - I'll reference Vail again, but having spent the last two years in major metros, I'm ready for a little more nature, though again, don't want isolation; cities (not booming metros) with large natural areas are okay

Parameters:

All I need for work is a quiet space and reliable Internet with decent speeds

My own space - I'm not a hostel or coliving kind of guy - this is mostly irrelevant here, except for...

Budget for rent: Here is where, knowing reddit, and not being new to this world, I think some of you may react, but let's keep in mind I'm not new to travel, I'm smart and highly resourceful, and I know what options exist.  I 'm simply looking for your recommendations on locations.  So... cheap as possible, but no more than 700/mo.  Before you want to say this and that, I've had entire guest houses in connected parts of France near Paris for 400.   Again, I'm resourceful.  The budget is to give you an idea (so no one says, 'Amsterdam,' for example).  Note, this is budget for rent, not monthly costs in total.

&#x200B;

Just looking for some ideas, because I feel both overwhelmed by options and also a bit stuck trying to mach desires with budget.  Some things that have already been bounced around, and are being considered: Greece (but where, and the quiet thing), Italy (but where), Budapest (if I had a quiet place, which I think I've found, it could work for a couple months, but looking to leave Eastern Europe).

Happy to look at Northern Europe, as well, but less keen in winter time, and guessing cost of living is too much at the moment.  If you know of some awesome places, or feel Baltics may work, let me know (haven't been to the Baltics, though a bit worried it will be much like other parts of Eastern Europe)

Yes, I've really laid it out, thank you for reading and using your energy to help.  I'm only showing pickiness / detail because I'm putting this out there to the wide web, so am trying to funnel a lot of potential information into a useful outcome.  Not sure if this thread will turn into a lot of random posts, or more of a discussion, but it would be cool to if this were a friendly thread.   If you've had great experiences in some random towns in Western Europe, I'd love to hear what town it was.  To get things rolling, I spent my first month in France in Noyon, which is small, a bit more conservative and working class, but was charming and nice, had easy access to slightly larger towns like Amiens and Compiegnes, and you could be in Paris within an hour, hour and a half.  Ultimately too isolated for more than a month, but a decent place if you're looking for some quiet without being too disconnected.

Thank you all so much!"

Mexican people are overtly friendly, educated, generous and empathetic.

The flora and fauna here is spectacular, food is **delicious** and if you shop where regular folk get there food (supermarkets away from tourist areas), most things are cheap.

If you're a pothead (casual smoker here, non daily) cannabis is dirt cheap. You can literally get a bag of weed for 10 USD.

Chilling on the beach, white sands and clear water, with your friends after a smoke is bliss.

Oh, and beer is super cheap as well.

Warm weather, the breeze...everything.

Rent is not that cheap, but Airbnb is popular, and there is a lot of competition.

You can get a house for the price of a room in Europe.

And no, Mexico, especially Cancun, is not a 3rd world country. Ive never been mugged, beaten or suffered corruption from the cops.

Internet is fast. You can get unlimited data for 15 USD a month on mobile.

Anyway, if you have been hesitant or thinking about being a DN in Mexico: don't think twice.

f6l0ow,fhxm6,Overlap between DN/FIRE communities?,"DN + US citizen here.  

I know there is an active tax planning subset within the DN community -- lots of advice re: FEIE (for US citizens), for example. DNs naturally end up reducing costs often by moving from high cost of living geographies to low cost of living ones (although not always).  

I was recently introduced to the FIRE community. For those of you who don't know what that is, it's a group of people who are trying to retire early by reducing expenses and maximizing income. In the US, this often translates to moving from San Francisco to Omaha, or to other low cost of living cities, for example, but also getting rid of expensive car leases, not going out to eat as much, and so on. This is all in the pursuit of saving huge amounts of your income (50-75% in some cases).   

""Retirement"" might mean working remotely and for only a few hours a week.  

What I'm wondering is if there is much overlap between the DN and FIRE communities? (I couldn't find many posts relating the two on this subreddit).   

As a DN, I've been able to reduce my cost of living dramatically and save more for retirement, while taking far more ""vacations,"" than I was able to do with an office job. I could do more, though.  

If there is community overlap, I'm interested in what DNs have found most helpful in terms of strategies for saving, and how they balance their DN lifestyle with extreme saving."

>iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, and later feature Dual SIM with a nano-SIM and an eSIM.1 An eSIM is a digital SIM that allows you to activate a cellular plan from your carrier without having to use a physical nano-SIM.

>Here are a few of the many ways you can use Dual SIM:

>Use one number for business and another number for personal calls.
Add a local data plan when you travel outside of the country or region.
Have separate voice and data plans.


This seems like an ideal set up for digital nomads, because we can keep our ""home"" service / phone number / ability to receive texts, *and* get a local number + cheap data. It also adds a nice layer of redundancy / fault-tolerance (if one network is slow or not working, you still have the other one), without having to carry two phones or swap SIMs.

I'm just gonna be a lone wolf, fuck off and leave all of my problems and everyone I know in the rear view and start over (again) but as a cyber security consultant that just bounces from country to country. I've never really felt at home anywhere. Moving around is the only thing I'm used to. Day by day, just leaving makes more and more sense..

Since travel insurance like WorldNomads isn't covering Coronavirus related claims, I'm looking for a policy that can protect us in case the virus becomes a significant issue in Europe.  Here are the details I'm looking for:

\- **We are able to decide when to exercise the policy**, not when the US government, for example, declares a mandatory evacuation.  This is because I think that the government will be very reluctant to issue such an order to those in the EU and if it gets that bad, we should be gone by then.

\- **Prepaid costs would be reimbursed**.  In our case, this would be AirBnB & courses we're enrolled in.

\- **Would pay to re-patriate us to the US**, which could be pretty expensive if people are trying to get out of Europe.

I'm not one of those people who is expecting an apocalypse of corona-zombies, but like any other insurance, I'd like to pay a small premium compared to the potentially high out of pocket costs.  Has anyone come across providers that issue policies similar to what I described above?"

* Equity firms will do ‘co-living rollups’ to form networks. Branding, booking, accounting and other services will be consolidated.
* The **next recession** will lead to more co-living

&#x200B;

**Opportunities**

* Start a co-living space (See this [guide](https://coliving.com/guide/how-to-start-a-coliving-business))
* Develop hardware for co-living spaces (Check out [SALTO](https://saltoks.com/coliving/))
* Create a co-living quiz to match residents to spaces 
* Create **subscription** services for co-living residents (snack packs, dry cleaning, curated clothing boxes)
* Develop **value-add** services for co-living spaces (fitness training, massages, cleaning, shuttles, catering, tours)
* Invest in a [REIT](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp) with co-living holdings
* Create [specialized furniture](https://a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_253/v1/propertyimages/9/90911/37.jpg) for co-living common areas
* Build software to solve co-living problems such as security and shared resource booking

f9zf9o,2oq16k3y,What do you think about this travel Itinerary? First timer working and traveling around the world.,"So I'm an Online English Teacher and I'm from Australia and my Wife is Mexican and we are currently in Mexico. We want to go travel around Asia and Europe for a year and a half while we wait for her visa to process coming to Australia. My wife is currently not working and I'm making $2,500usd - $3,000usd a month. I'm just hoping for any advice as a first timer as a nomad working around the world. We have created an itinerary and it looks like this..

Vietnam (80 days) (around a month in each city) 
 1. Ho chi Minh City
 2. Hanoi
 3. Da Nang

Malaysia ( 27 days)
1. Kuala Lumpa

Indonesia (2 months approx)
1. Ubud, Bali

Georgia ( 30 - 60 days)
1. Tbilisi

Turkey (30 days approx)
1. Istanbul 

Hungary (60 days approx) 
1. Budapest

Bulgaria (30 days) 
1. Sofia

Romania (30 days) 
1. Brasov

Croatia (30 days) 
1. Dubrovnik 

Bosnia & Herzegovina (30 days) 
1. Sarajevo

Spain (part of the Schengen area) (30 days) 
1. Granada, Andalucia

Portugal (part of the schengen area) (30 days) 
1. Lisbon 

This is just a general idea of where we plan to go and for how long. We plan on starting in Asia then going over to Europe. I need to have good wifi at all the places we go so I assume airbnb is the best option for us to use as accommodation. The only problem might be the corona virus as it might make it hard to travel to some of these places in the next 2 or 3 months. Im hoping to have $10,000AUD saved before we leave just incase. Any other places to go to and any advice will be greatly appreciated also let me know what you think of the itinerary we have planned. Thanks in advance! :)"

fbfles,3kijt,LARGEST portable monitor?,"**TL;DR: I'm looking for the biggest USB-C portable monitor I can find. >17 inches? The review sites are out-of-date, do you know if something like this exists?**

I've been digging around for portable monitors. Here's the criteria I want:

* Absolutely nothing below FHD/1080p, but I'd prefer at least 2k/1440p
* USB-C video and power (no second cable for power!)
* 60 hz
* Good image quality and color (probably an IPS panel)
* Big (19-24"")
* <5 lbs
* Would be nice: eye height stand instead of reclining on the desk
* Would be nice: no speakers/no headphone jack

I work with game engines that don't tend to do well with UI scaling, and have lots of small text, so I'm willing to make some sacrifices in the luggage department to maximize screen size. 15 inches isn't really cutting it.

I bought a Magedok M173A, which on paper is everything I want (17"", 120hz, 2k), but the panel quality is just absolute trash, terrible color, limited contrast. I'm pretty unhappy with it, but... I guess it's still the best contender?

So then I bought an MSI Optix MAG161v. This monitor looks pretty great (though not as great as my spectacular MSI Stealth Thin laptop monitor), and is super lightweight, and has all the finer touches I expect from MSI. And something I didn't appreciate right away is that it fits inside my laptop bag. Buuuuut 1080p at 15 inches, and it's not really doing the job I'm hoping it would do as far as screen real estate. My laptop monitor is elevated better, which makes it superior to the MSI Optix MAG161v reclining on the desk. So it's not so much an improvement, as an addition... not really happy with that.

A while back I also pre-ordered a ASUS ROG Strix XG17AHPE. 17 inches, 240 hz, 1080p. I suspect the image quality is going to be great, but I haven't seen it yet BECAUSE THEY DELAYED THE RELEASE. Ugh! I think this could replace the Magedok as leading contender, but will it ever come out?

Despite hours and hours of research and buying, I still had not heard of the Asus ProArt PQ22UC, which is apparently my monitor El Dorado... by which I mean this monitor must be literally made of gold because it costs $3,885. It's everything I want, 21"", 4k, 61hz, great image quality, and an eye level stand! But really? A $4k piece of equipment in my checked baggage?

Somehow after all this reading and research I had missed the one monitor that was actually what I want, so maybe there's another monitor that competes with the Asus ProArt PQ22UC for a somewhat less insane price?

**Does anyone know if there's a sub-$2000 19-24"" portable monitor out there that I haven't found yet?**  


EDIT: The Magedok M173A died within the first month so I returned it.  
EDIT: The MSI Optix MAG161v  stand melted because it saw the sun through a window on a cloudy day and it doesn't stand right anymore, pretty disappointed.  
EDIT: I eventually got my ASUS ROG Strix XG17, and I'm pretty happy with it. Wish it was 1440p though."

fc9aw8,6i232,Got a check sent under my name..At home - How to deposit?,"Hello! 

I've been on the road for about 18 months now with my permanent address listed as my mom's home back in the US. This works great as she's able to keep an eye on any important mail items coming through, etc. She just told me I got an unexpected check in the mail (how often does that happen??). My question is, how tf do I deposit this?? My banking apps allow for 'remote' deposit, but it requires that you use the camera app, you can't browse for a picture you may already have. 

I see a few options: 

\- I can try to get my mom to send over a picture of the check and I use the app's deposit feature to try and take a picture of the picture - has anyone had any luck with this? Not sure if the app will be able to tell the check isn't 'in person'?

\- Try to add my mom to my bank account so she has permissions and can deposit it for me, but I feel like this is also going to be quite a hassle. 

\- I'm not seeing any family members on our travels anytime soon so can't ask someone to bring it with them. 

\- I can ask her to mail the check to where I'm staying or the next spot as we stay for a month at each place, but I've never gotten mail sent to myself on the road.

Then the ambulance and police process started.

The place immediately agreed to cancel my reservation and let me move somewhere else. I received a cancellation email from Booking.com confirming my refund.

3 weeks later I called them because they hadn't refunded my card yet. They said they called the owner, he agreed to the refund, and they'll call me back. They never did.

A week later I called them. Now they said their policy is they need to see screenshots of my payment for the place.

Fine. I replied to their email with screenshots. They never emailed me back.

I called back a couple hours later. Now they need me to submit the same files, but through an online form.

Can I talk to a supervisor? No. There is no process for doing that.

Can I escalate this issue? No. There is no process for doing that.

Anyways, I’ve always considered my life semi-normal, but I’ve been through a few experiences. 

I was born in Russia and spent five years in an orphanage. When I remember certain memories- the movie Matilda came to mind. If we misbehaved, we would line up and the woman in charge would spank us once with a wooden object. My adoptive parents had to bribe and basically smuggle me to get to America. 

Growing up was fun- I’d spend my free time playing sports and developing great bonds with people who have been my friends for 20+ years. 

I spent my high school summers in Mexico volunteering, helping families with green houses and gardening. I learned how to kill rabbits for dinner and I had to walk two miles each way to get water for the day. 

For the past few years, and even during my college years, I spent my time traveling around Europe using my savings, living in Italy, and learning a few languages. Two of my Italian friends are chefs who own their own restaurants, so I learned how to make fresh pasta, gnocchi, pizza dough, and tomato sauce. 

Now, I have an itch to go to Asia and spend a chunk of my time learning a form of martial arts and/or holistic medicine. 

I feel so alive when I connect with people and speak other languages and learn skills and have new experiences. It’s said that humans need comfort and routine, but I feel the opposite. 

Also- I used to be such a shy homebody. I definitely have developed my personality and grown so much."

fcxir3,5u6flyex,Airbnb prices are reaching levels of total madness. Here is my opinion. What's yours?,"Hello, I have been traveling for 1.5 years and using airbnb on a daily basis (and being a frequent user during the previous years) I have been able to observe how the prices have been rising non-stop especially during the last year or so. They have been increasing during the previous years already but this year they seem to have gone out of hands.

I see people asking for their monthly airbnb places 100% and even 150% more than the long term rental price in regions like Eastern Europe, the Balkans or North Africa. Not to mention western or central Europe...

Also, I keep noticing more and more how this uncontrolled escalation is breaking the local rental markets and some local people in some cities literally hate the idea of having airbnb's in their neighborhoods because of how they [impact the price of their rentals](https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeejhouse/v_3a38_3ay_3a2017_3ai_3ac_3ap_3a14-24.htm). In some areas people even actively fight against it like in [Athens](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-50075503) or [Barcelona](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/29/the-airbnb-invasion-of-barcelona). 

Two questions:

1. Do you see any alternative for short-term stays (less than 6 months)?
2. If you use airbnb, do you try to reduce the impact on the local market in some way? Like renting only rooms and no full houses, volunteering, etc.

My responses:

1. I don't. Living in a hotel room for a few months is mentally unhealthy, hostels are not a good option if you are working on a daily basis and long term rentals would imply losing the deposit if you leave earlier.
2. I have tried renting rooms but sometimes the price of the rooms is equally expensive or close to the price of a full house. I thought about volunteering but I feel like it would only make sense if I could find a volunteering option directly related to the house scarcity situation.

Im Australian, and I plan to get a 60 day tourist visa and renew for 30 days for a total of 90days.

I know theres also a 60 day multi entry visa which I would prefer to get but it requires 200,000 baht proof of funds which I dont have. Id ideally like to get a 1 year non-immigrant business visa too but I dont have any business to invite me. Unless anyone knows of a service that writes invitation letters?

fdz7n1,6aeu8,"Proposed strategy for recovering 2FA accounts, after you've lost all your possessions, and disappeared for a while (coma, 3rd world prison, etc).","My proposed 2FA strategy is to use Authy w/Backup Password on your primary email address, and SMS 2FA on a secondary email address.  Below is the math, and probability of total loss.

---

**Gmail.com**: This is your primary email account.  For 2FA, use Authy w/Backup Password.  Put all your 2FA backup/recovery codes in a password protected word docx, in a password protected zip file, inside your Google Drive (3 layers of different passwords).

**Outlook.com**: For 2FA, use cellphone SMS.  Put all your 2FA backup/recovery codes in a password protected word docx, in a password protected zip file, inside your Microsoft OneDrive (3 layers of different passwords).

---

**Disaster Scenario ""A""** (1% chance): You lose all your possessions, and disappear for a while (coma, 3rd world prison, etc).  When you re-emerge, Authy no longer works (company went out of business, and current OS & software & websites are no longer compatible with legacy Authy).  

**Disaster Scenario ""B""** (1% chance): You lose all your possessions, and disappear for a while (coma, 3rd world prison, etc).  When you re-emerge, you discover that your cellphone provider has reclaimed your cellphone number for non-payment.

---

If you had used Authy w/Backup Password on both Gmail & Outlook.com, your chance of losing control of your accounts is 1%.

If you had used SMS 2FA on both Gmail & Outlook.com, your chance of losing control of your accounts is 1%.

**BUT** if you had used Authy w/Backup Password on one account, and SMS 2FA on the other account, you have two ways back to your 2FA backup/recovery codes.  Thus, the chance of losing control of your accounts is much lower (1% x 1% = 0.01%).

I just formed a HoldCo LLC & Trust in Nevis, and i am now looking into corporate banking solutions. It will be hard to open an onshore bank account with a Nevis LLC, but i can use the Bank of Nevis without any problems. Let’s say i don’t trust offshore banks to store a large sum of money (2M+) long-term, then where should i consider storing it even more safer?

That’s pretty much all she did and was able to make enough to pay for a studio apartment in San Francisco (so she was making decent money). She was able to log in and work whenever she wanted and she didn’t have to deal with coworkers or supervisors etc. The only restraint on the work was that when she would log in, the work was timed and needed to be completed accordingly. It seemed like a pretty good side gig. Does anyone know what I’m describing or anything like it worth checking out?

fhxa3u,l440a,Quieter Alternative to Belgrade?,"After two years, Belgrade is the one place I am ready to call home, BUT, I cannot find a peaceful place here.   Well sound-proofed unit - not against the full remodel upstairs; quiet courtyard studio - oh, we didn't mention you share a wall with a kafana; stand-alone house with the whole upper floor to myself rented as a flat (how could this go wrong) - neighbor's dog sits outside my door barking for five hours a day (and then at night, too).  I am currently in a place I really love, have the option to sign a lease, but there is so little soundproofing, I can be woken up by a bedtime conversation of the couple upstairs, or the man getting out of bed when he can't sleep, and the entire ceiling bends downward when they drop something.  After eight apartments in four months, I am starting to consider there may be a better city.

I am sensitive to noise, admittedly, but I've done generally okay in Belgrade, though it's starting to wear on me more.  I love how friendly it is here.  As a bit of an ambivert, I can get by without close friends simply by way of all the friendly people, chats with store owners where I frequent, etc.  I've been reading about Estonia being good for quiet, but I also read it's nearly impossible to make friends and people don't even like eye contact or friendly greetings.  Couldn't do that.  I need an environment that is diverse and easy to interact with (without being overbearing - SE Asia was hell for me both on noise and nosiness), some nature around (I live a two minute walk from woods of Zvezdara Park here) preferably, but also either construction that lends itself to better sound isolation, or just a quieter environment (I really don't like super quiet places, I like there to be LIFE, but I like everyone else's lives to be kept out of my home).   

Looking to stay around Europe, Eastern Europe is probably best for budget and health matters (looking at you coronavirus), but can't deal with some of the colder attitudes (hence concern about Estonia, Poland was shit to me - maybe just my personal experience in Krakow, but wow were people aggressively inconsiderate and generally miserable - get-togethers with people typically meant I listened to them bitch about everything under the sun for hours - drained me).  

Any suggestions?  

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Suggestions for lively, friendly place with things going on, maybe some nature nearby, but good for quiet living at home (construction conducive to soundproofing, or quieter culture without being unfriendly)?

I can also accept it if such a place does not exist, but hoping some of you have crossed paths with such a place.  I really am a bit loathe to leave Belgrade after years of the ""wrong places,"" and liking it here so much, but I have tried SO many apartments here already, it's getting time to sign a lease or try something new, maybe."

That’s starting to fall apart. Are any other nomads who housesit out there finding the same? What are your plans? “Stay where you are/stay at home” doesn’t work when your nomadding style doesn’t involve renting short term accommodation. 

My situation: Currently in Oz but the next homeowner was scheduled to go to Spain and Italy for 5 weeks so, no surprises, has cancelled. Fortunately they want to spend two weeks travelling domestically so there’s still housesitting to do. But that’s 3 weeks in the near future that I’m essentially homeless. Plus Australia is expensive to stay in when not housesitting, and my income is tied to European flights so I’m expecting a drop, if not complete disappearance of revenue. So the immediate future is uncertain. 

Longer term I have had a month long sit in summer in Canada cancel (they were due to go on a cruise). My country is on a travel ban to the US where another housesit (apparently still going ahead, despite being located in Washington State...) is scheduled.

The economy will return to normal and there will be more opportunities for growth than ever before. But remain flexible. 

Remote work is the new normal. 

You need a new approach to productivity. 

Spending time with online communities is important as a proxy for our social life needs. 

Establish rapport with people who have the right mindset for your mental health. 

Avoid consuming social media in a dark hypothetical feedback loop; this will deflate your mind and eventually your body.

Stay physically active. 

Don't succumb to nerd neck by slouching over and developing tunnel vision from excessive screen time. 

Give yourself calming breaks. 

Do whatever it takes to stay lean and sane.

If anyone is interested in the ""boots on the ground"" observations in Danang, I would describe it as a slightly paranoid ghost town. Multiple businesses (especially restaurants/bars) are closed with signs referencing COVID-19, and many others are closed with no signs despite having hours posted showing that they should be open. Grocery stores are still fully stocked, but there's not too many people out and about. The beach and weather are both brilliant, but of course the mood is somewhat somber. Walking around without a mask, even outside, gets many stink eye looks.

My initial plan was just to stay here to avoid traveling. Try to stay in my airbnb as much as possible. But I'm worried that the Mexican government is not taking this situation seriously and feel like being in such a huge city may not be a great idea right now.

I am starting to think it may be better to go to a smaller city. I was thinking possibly Oaxaca or maybe somewhere with less tourism would be better.

fl4mba,1510t2,For those outside the USA right now.. how's it like where you're at? Here's how it is in the Philippines at the moment..,"I'm currently in the Philippines..

About a week ago they segregated and sectioning off the country in to sections.

Stopped most ferries from going.. basically gave people a few days warning.. and now it's basically whatever island you're on, big or small.. you're stuck there for as long as this goes on. I know a few islands that have no airport and no ferries.. so yes.. you're stuck.

Then cut off domestic flights.

Then gave a nationwide curfew.

Then Quarantined all of Luzon (the largest populated area including Manila) and all stores ordered to close which they are tightening more and more each day.

Now they are closing some grocery stores (like mine, the only one in town).

Which leaves one very small local/wet market (basically no canned goods) just rice, fresh veggies and fish.

Will they close this too? Now that the grocery store is closed will they raise prices 2-5x to keep up with demand?

They're starting to give out one designated pass per family for grocery shopping. That's ONE pass in one persons name.. basically restricting the whole rest of the family from leaving their house.

They're also forcing hotels/hostels to close.. basically trying to kick out foreigners from them and telling them 'good luck' ..

Even some locals long term apartments are telling foreigners they won't rent to them.

Pretty much all the touristy things are shut down or are being shut down in the next few days.. I think the dive shops is all that's left but I think today or tomorrow is their last day open.

This is all in the past week by the way..

So if you're thinking about going home and not willing to possibly ride this thing out through the rest of 2020 and beyond.. you may want to think about flying back home ASAP as it seems there are more restrictions by the day on air travel, hence the crazy prices I've seen to get back home (USA).

If you don't leave NOW.. this week.. you may be stuck in whatever country your in.

Where country are you in?  And how have things changed?"

flb4pk,1a6nonps,Is this the end of the typical digital nomad lifestyle?,"I assume when this is over, flight prices will be a lot more expensive than usual. Or who knows, they might even be cheap at the beginning and then suddenly increase due to a massive demand for travel.

Plus, It may take a very long time until countries open their borders again and a recession is most likely coming next.

And of course, in the worst-case scenario, the virus mutates and ends up becoming deadlier, just like what happened with the spanish flu.

So even though remote work is increasing exponentially, we'll be forced to stay home for an undetermined amount of time.

So is this the end of the typical digital nomad lifestyle for the next few years?

I'm stuck home and I have no idea what my next step is. Even though I still have clients and work I feel like all my plans were based around traveling and now everything has become extremely uncertain and lacking purpose.

I'm not panicking and honestly, as a remote worker, my life is pretty much a quarantine when I'm not on the road, so it's been pretty easy to adapt. But I am feeling pessimistic regarding the state of the travel industry, the global economy and future visa applications.

Hope for the best prepare for the worst.

I'm a digital nomad and doing my taxes as such for the first time, which is also my first time doing it as a freelancer. I moved out of the US in march of 2019, and since then have been back for 3 weeks in late november. I don't have residency in any country, just move around every 3 months or so in eastern europe.

I found a tax preparing service focused on expats/nomads that seems legit and was recommended to me by someone. I've never had to have someone prepare my taxes for me, and the price seems really steep to me. I made something like $35,000 in 2019, and for my federal taxes, state taxes, and an additional schedule C I require, the price is $740. Is this normal? I legitimately have very few to no deductions, so I don't think I'm going to be able to get a lot out of even a great tax service, especially since I didn't make much.

I get that expat tax services would cost a bit more than normal, so what is a good range to expect for good service? Anyone have anyone that they can recommend? The person I'm working with so far, just asking questions and getting stuff set up, seems really professional and helpful, but if I can find a better deal I would go for it. Thanks!"
flvnba,d552bij,"The future of DN - Taxation, Popularity, and the Changes We Should Prepare For.","Hello All,
It’s no secret that remote work is exploding in the wake of COVID19. What impact will this have on DN Community? My thoughts:

1) Remote work is here to stay - this almost makes me a little said/jealous. I busted ass to get my remote job and it just won’t be very special after this, but hey, the more the merrier right? 
2) Now that everyone realizes work can be done remotely, a lot of jobs will stay that way. Will people take the opportunity to travel? 
3) If a lot of people begin to travel as a DN, how long before governments wake up and start demanding a slice of our check or requiring “remote work” visas for extended stays. At a minimum, I can see increased scrutiny at the boarder over a 3 month stay. “How are you supporting yourself? I see you have a lap top, will you be working while here?”

fmumwd,,Mexico: Mifi vs Wifi Modem vs DSL for Videochat?,"Hi!

I work online teaching English to kids in China via videochat. I live in Mexico and am moving to a rural area with very limited internet options: DSL (Telmex) or cellular (Telcel). There's no fiber optic 'round these parts.

The company I work for ideally wants at least 20mb up/2mb down with a ping of less than 100. Upload and ping are the more important of those numbers.

So, any thoughts on which combination has the potential to be best-- or the least bad-- for speed and ping?

**a)** Telcel cellular network via mifi or phone, no cap on speeds (I get approx. 20 up/20 down), can't use ethernet but can plug into my laptop with USB--I don't know if that has the same effect as using ethernet?

**b)** Telcel cellular network via wifi modem, 10mb max speed, can use ethernet

**c)** Telmex DSL, 20mb max speed, can use ethernet (Note: am currently using this network at my hotel and it's unusable for my classes bc the upload is .4. But I'm not connected via ethernet, only via wifi. I don't know how far I am from the router.)

**d)** Could any of the above be improved by adding other equipment, ie an external antenna, signal repeater, connecting mifi to a router, etc?

I would like to share with other IT folk and people getting into this industry how to fast track your first few years to get to the top fastest.

- Researching the market: Knowing what skills are in demand.  
- Your first 1.5 years - Type of company to learn the most. 
- Start to teach others (before you are ready) - git/blog/stackoverflow
- 1 company for 5 years vs 5 companies for 1 year each 
- Being in demand - & staying up to date
- Job App Process - CV, Interviews, Negotiation 
- Permentant vs Contract work

I have been an English teacher for all of my adult, post-graduate school life. I enjoy teaching, but I have been wanting to change my career path and become a digital nomad for a few years now. Okay, I will admit I often envy the cool-looking digital nomads I see in coffee shops while traveling around different countries. 

Given my rather *limited* skill set, it has been difficult finding a digital job. I am a great editor, but every company I have viewed online wants at least 3 years of editing experience. The same thing goes for copywriting and technical writing. Transcribing does not seem to pay enough. 

I am also considering going back to school for a year or so and learning something tech-y such as software engineering, UX, UI, etc.

I have heard that some of the remote job market is quite saturated. In your opinion, what digital jobs are in high-demand (or just simply in demand) and profitable? Keep in mind I am a teacher. I am accustomed to not making a lot of money, and I am surprisingly okay with it.

fvgq9a,f8k4jcp,An Island nation for Digital Nomads," 

Hello all,

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

the subbreddit is reddit.com/[r/theredditnation](https://www.reddit.com/r/theredditnation/)

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy (for now I will be the “king”)  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

1. No COVID-19 included travel insurance available.
2. Borders closed for tourists in almost every country.
3. If you are in a country and need healthcare (insured or not), you might not be able to get it due to their systems being completely overwhelmed.

My estimate is that it won't return to normal till the end of the year at the minimum and for some developing countries it might take 2-3 years."

I want to ask to European people ( preferably south European, I'm from Spain ) which place do you love as your 2nd home. I don't close any door to all options but I have a few priorities:

1. I'm a woman and I'll be alone. The suggested place should be a safe place for people like me.

2. Good internet, as I'll be working online.

3. Good food and cheap monthly ( 500$/month is a good number but I'm open to any option if it's a good fit ).

I prefer some Asian countries as it seems to have what I look for ( cheap, good internet, good food, safe and beautiful ). Latin countries could be an option too if they're a safe place ( I'm Spanish so language is not a problem ). I was looking for a working holiday visa in Japan but due to the quarantine I should wait until I can ask for it.

Any suggestions?

As the title suggests, I'm a soon-to-be college graduate considering the digital nomad lifestyle for the first year of my adult life. I just got accepted for a fully-remote internship position that runs from Sep 2020-Sep 2021, requiring \~30 hrs/wk of work and paying me \~$3000/mo. My girlfriend and I are hoping to spend those 12 months traveling around the world and living in different cities for around 2-4 weeks at a time while I am working and she is completing an online degree (she won't be earning any money, so we will have a budget of \~$3000/mo for two people).

Any tips/advice for how to go about planning a trip like this to take advantage of the opportunity, but make sure it is still feasible financially?

A few notes:

\-We are hoping to spend at least a few months in each of the following parts of the world: South America, India, Southeast Asia, Western Europe, Eastern Europe. Probably more time in the cheaper  parts, and less in the more expensive ones (lookin at u Western Europe)

\-We are planning to keep an emergency fund of minimum \~$5000

\-We are both US citizens, and I'm working for a US company which will pay me in USD

I'm lucky enough to have found the newbie starter kit on this subreddit, and I've been reading through some popular DN blogs for advice on how to prepare. Any advice, however broad or specific, is SUPER welcome from you all.

g3b38e,1d9tkpn4,In the middle of an existential crisis and looking for advice. (X-post),"Hey nomads, as you all basically live the life that I dream of, I thought you might be able to offer some advice...

Having an existential crisis and need advice.

I sit here on the verge of tears with a tight chest, wondering if this shit is right for me. I'm in my 30s with a family to care for and am questioning if I even have what it takes to continue in this path. Rant incoming...

It wasn't always this way. I used to enjoy computers  a lot. As I got older, I began caring less about tech and keeping up with current trends. I started teaching myself about 6 years ago with the goal of getting a job in this field, because I enjoy creating and have always been good with computers. I succeeded. 

Been working as a developer for the past 5 years and have always been complemented for my good work and friendly personality. Am I great? Hell no. I imagine average at best. I taught myself what I needed to in order to start creating. I didn't then and still don't give a fuck about LeetCode, big O, ds & algs, and suck horribly at math. Sure, these are important and I'm not downplaying them, but I have to be realistic in knowing that my mind doesn't work that way. I'm a creative individual who happened to be good at computers. I also am not amazed by how the latest version of the language can do the same thing in a different syntax. Nor am I fascinated by writing intricate db queries. I'm so tired of feeling left out wondering why and how all of the people I work with and see in these forums are so interested while I'm there not giving a fuck. I can't force myself to care about these things, though that doesn't say that I'm not caring and proud of the work I do. I actually don't even hate every part of the job.

You know what I've enjoyed? Creating a cool looking frontend for the user or something neat like that. Seeing a project from start to finish and having the person I developed it for be happy was a nice feeling also. But then again, we get into the technical side of front end where ""font this, whitespace that, alignment here, oh wait...make this pop more""...fuck me. Here I am with 5 years of mainly back end Java experience, wishing to get out of coding for 7-8 straight hours a day into something more crud like in a non-tech company, so I can at least keep the nice paychecks and lifestyle. I've seen people saying that they don't code more than 2-4 hours a day and complaining, while that sounds ideal to me. I wanted to work fully remote and even posted that not long ago, but it's obvious I will be bested by so many out there. It won't stop me from trying, but still, I feel so fucked. 

Please don't get me wrong. I'm a very passionate person and take a lot of care and pride in the work that I do. I consider myself to be friendly, introverted yet social, and easy to get along with. I find I'm so different from other devs though. Again, I don't mean to rant, but I hope you can understand that at this moment I feel down and hopeless. Yes, I'm depressed right now, but I know how to deal with that stuff. I'm situationally depressed, because I feel lost and don't know what to do. Not to mention that I suffer with arm problems and struggle getting through each day. 

I'm grinding myself to death in something that is ever increasingly making me miserable, yet is seemingly my only skill.  Well, I play piano, played around with producing music and love food, but making a life out of that is even more impossible. Believe me, I wanted to play music professionally, but I can't be the starving artist while I have a family to take care of. All I really want out of my life is to enjoy traveling with my family and be able to afford a modest lifestyle. Sometimes I feel like quitting it all and going to teach English in SEA. I'm not trying to give up on this, but I don't know what to do. I started teaching myself JavaScript thinking maybe front end will be better, but who knows? 

All I want is the ability to work remotely, be able to travel and enjoy my life outside of work and not hate what I do. I don't hate all of developing, I really enjoy the creative side, but that's it. The nitty gritty details, I want to be as far from that shit as possible. I don't even mind the boring crud shit, if it allows me to live the life I want. I like helping people more than I enjoy being a damn robot. I can't continue to be a fucking robot my whole life.

Some advice and guidance would be much appreciated. I'm even open to ideas outside of software development. Thank you to whomever took the time to read this."

At the moment our online salary is around 20-25k per year . That is just her income as I have not started any independent work yet -- though I plan to. 

We have a dog, and a baby. 

We'd like to stay in Europe, if possible. We'd also like to not be in either of our home counties. Also, no Georgia (they won't let my wife in for any reason, the jerks!)

Any options that we could consider would be greatly appreciated!

EDIT: I should probably mention that this is idea, if it happens, wouldn't happen until June 2021."

hope you don't mind me asking yet another Panama residency question on here (Sorry!)

Basically, I'm in my early twenties just about to finish school and the travelling while working lifestyle seems really appealing to me.

I have been doing some research on the Panama Friendly Nations Visa/Permanent residency process and have read that it is going to be closed or tightened very soon.

So, 

I was just wondering whether anyone thought it would be worth it to try and set it up now, before it's too late incase I might like to use it later in life?
Am I right in thinking that even if I didn't end up being a digital nomad, if I lived inside the country I'm employed in for less than 6 months a year then I'd just pay tax wherever I am 'resident' (which in Panama would be 0% as foreign income.)
It does sound too good to be true, which means it probably is but some advice over whether anyone thinks it is worth it would be great!

Cheers

I have been traveling around the world for the last 7 months with no problems, and when I suggested to my husband to open an account (since they don't offer joint accounts) because he is going to the Phillippines - that is where problems started to happen. When we were transferring money from our other banks into one account at TransferWise, they deactivated both of our accounts. Phone and twitter support is horrible and told me I needed to file an appeal and wait ten days for a response.

At this point, I don't care. In essence, I don't like dealing with companies that don't try to communicate to ask us questions about where the money is coming from. Especially when I start reading that appeals are close to ZERO to get accounts reactivated. I have over $2k in that account frozen, and my husband has over $500 in that account.

g6v1rb,7yds7,Client outreach strategy,"I've been a copywriter for a pretty long time now. But up until now, I've almost always been employed full-time with a company.

But now, I've been taking my freelance work much more seriously. I don't know whether you feel the same way, but I believe that no employer will ever care about my livelihood and that of my family as much as I do. Which is why I wanna switch completely to freelance.

So I've been doing a little experiment lately.

I'm doing cold email outreach, sending out around 15-25 cold emails per day.

They're short email, very candid, very upfront. Stuff like, ""Hey, I'm a copywriter. Need any writing done?""

And I'm really excited with the results. I'm getting very encouraging open rates and conversion to clients.

But the key takeaway I want to share here is this:

Client outreach is a game of numbers. I used to make the mistake of trying to qualify leads BEFORE the first outreach step. But that is SUICIDE!

Here's why.

The more time you spend sourcing a lead, the higher the cost of that lead is going to be, so the smaller the ROI.

Yes, you need to qualify leads, but only after they've responded. That's where you take the time to get to know them and build relationships.

But at the cold outreach stage, don't look anyone in the face. I practically ignore the company name. In fact, during one of my cold outreach sessions, I came across a company that I thought would be ""too big"" for me. I very nearly skipped it. Then I caught myself and said, ""No, the strategy is to email everyone, so I'll email them. Worst case, they'll refuse"". And what do you know, they're actually interested.

Maybe what I wrote above is all common sense to you. And if that's the case, that's cool :-)

But if what I shared can benefit at least one person, I'm happy."

This is more than just a list: every site is concisely summarized and the directory is broken down into two parts, general and technical.

I mainly do UI/UX stuff, website, mobile and some graphic design. Coding, too. For the past 10+ years I've been working only on desktop workstations, whether it is remotely from home, or in previous companies that I've worked for.

I think screen size doesn't matter for coding, but my concern is that 13, 15 or 17 inch screen size is a bit too small to actually design on. I could be wrong here. I guess I'm used to a bigger display with more real-estate. When I do testings on laptops, it always looks a bit tiny compared to a display, which is perfectly normal.

gat358,6266n,"Question on taxes, freelancing, company base","Hi! If this has been discussed before please point me to the correct links and feel free to delete this post.

I was wondering how one chooses the country to base their company to. 

My situation is this: my country of origin is Greece (Greek nationality), for the last 4+ years I live in Belgium (Belgian residence), and I'm planning to begin my almost-digital-nomad journey as soon as it's safe to do so. I mention ""almost"" because I plan on changing countries of residence every year or so (so not every few months). My first destination is the UK (where, exceptionally, I plan on staying more than just one year, let's say roughly 3).

Say a US company wants to hire me for remote contract work. What are my options?

If I start a company, where should it be based/taxed? Greece, Belgium, the UK? Is there a site (EU maybe?) that I can check for all these stuff?

PS: I understand that being a freelancer is the same thing legally as starting a company/being self-employed, if I'm wrong please let me know, this is all very new to me.

Thanks!"
gb7k8t,q8jo3vz,Question About Working While on Vacation and Coworking Spaces,"Hello all, I work as a business intelligence analyst. Have traveled for vacation, but never worked while traveling outside of checking emails and quick responses. I want to get in on this after everything starts to open back up again. My company does have a list of countries we are allowed to VPN from.

I have started doing research on coworking spaces, coffices, as well as subletting an airbnb short term in Bogota or Montevideo.

My main unanswered question is this: Are we allowed to work for a US company, while having a homebase in the US for mailing purposes, and a US bank account where my salary is deposited to while in another country on a tourist visa?

I am looking for answers from people with actual experience doing this by the way. For the people who will more than likely shoot from the hip and say ""Check the embassy website, etc."". I have, most of the wording for needing a type of resident/working visa is based on finding work while in the country, and I cant really find anything in regard to remote work that is sourced from the home country. Again, not looking for anecdotal information, if anyone has experience with this it would be helpful. I assume theres no harm doing this for say a month while on a tourist visa since I am not collecting payroll from a company within the visited country.

In regard to Coworking spaces, I see it seems most just provide a desk and wifi. For my work I really need two screens to be efficient. Do most coworking spaces have a second monitor for use and all you need to do is ask? Is it cheaper just to buy a second monitor for a private coworking desk?

Thanks again for any help guys!"

gbewmp,7yds7,Questions about copywriting? Ask me.,"Hi all.

Yesterday was my last day at my full-time remote job. I've got freelance work coming in, but it's a sever blow to my income.

But life has taught me that when something gets taken away from you, the best way to get back on your feet is to start giving without asking anything in return. Life has an odd tendency to reward such actions in unexpected but positive ways.

So that's what I want to do in this thread.

I'm a veteran copywriter with experience in SaaS, eCommerce, tech, video games and lots more. I want to help, with no expectation of compensation.

So, if you have questions about copywriting, or you want me to have a look at any copy, ask me here, without any reservation.

My only request is that we keep the discussions and advice public so that everyone on the sub can gain something from it.

Thanks, and best of health to you all.

EDIT: Most of the questions I'm getting start with ""This might sound cliche/silly/obvious etc"". Please, don't say that. I've been there. No question is silly if it's genuine. Ask me anything, even if it's a complete beginner's question. And don't hesitate to ask for clarification. I've been in this profession for a while, so I've come to take certain things for granted that might not be obvious to everyone. If something is unclear, tell me and I'll go deeper.

gc1sun,3ua3uult,Is it still good to get into Web Dev for remote jobs in 2020?,"Hi all, I'm thinking about switching/evolving my skillset to support the digital nomad style.

My background is in UX Design. I'm the typical silicon valley designer - worked at big tech companies, spent most of my time on emails, meetings, documentation, and so forth. Everything was going well until early 2018. There was a family emergency and I had to quit my job to leave silicon valley. 

I left SV in mid-2018 to take care of my family. Then I took some time off, traveled around, and found out about digital nomading. During the whole year of 2019.  I was working part-time and remotely for a small startup while traveling around Asia. 

I really liked the lifestyle and started to think about it long-term. I noticed that it's much easier to get a remote job as a web developer and it also requires a lot less communication. Also, with my experience in design, it's easy for me to transition into frontend development at least. 

&#x200B;

However, I do have some concerns regarding this path. My questions are the following:

&#x200B;

\- I saw many people learning web development. Is the job market now saturated?

\- As I have a strong design background, what are the best ways to leverage my strength? Is design/dev hybrid a hot skill in the market? If I need to market myself for jobs, should I mention I have a design background?

\- What are the best ways for junior dev to get a remote job? Is it hard? Should junior dev get an onsite job first and gain experience before applying to remote jobs?

&#x200B;

All suggestions are welcome! Thanks so much :D 

And if your team happen to look for a designer who's learning frontend dev and interested in transitioning into developer -- Please feel free to DM :DDD"

I'm considering checking out Merida when all this hysteria calms down.

How will this affect us nomads post-COVID?

* Expect some popular nomad locales (both rural and urban) to get more crowded and pricey
* More of a market, I s'pose, for all you nomads who just offer services to other nomads
* More options, as more employers discover that people actually can get work done, often better, remotely
* More competition for remote jobs
* Products (e.g., portable second screens) for digital nomads become more popular and profitable, more are produced eventually
* More standardization of banking options, human resources services, etc. for far-flung employees
* If universities function remotely into next fall, will it become a new normal? Will some increased aspect of university education remain online? Will the costs of housing near universities drop? Will universities have to compete more with other forms of distance education on price etc.? What options and opportunities does this make for the already-nomadic to educate or get educated?
* What else?

Like any huge shock to a system, it would be strange if this didn't create all sorts of large and potentially permanent secondary effects.

EDIT: Yes, yes, I agree with you folks, remote does not equal digital nomad, obviously. But since the perceived inability or undesirability of working remotely is often a main holdup, at least some fair chunk of that 60% might eventually give some degree of nomadism a whirl, now that they experience the possibilities. And this in turn should have effects on those of us already enjoying the lovely lifestyle. It may become more socially accepted, common, less frowned on by employers, etc. "

\*\*What's the best solution do you know to keep the cheap, ideally lifetime long number to receive SMS confirmations? \*\*

I'm a nomad since 2014, and until probably 2016 I used my Russian MTC number where I put  significant sum of money but these scammers deactivated my phone number due to low activity regardless of the balance. Later on, I used different local sim cards but got tired of switching numbers for all numerous services. The last November I bought Google Fi - it works great, but the minimum maintains price $20 a month, which isn't a lot if you use it as a business person for the work, but if you keep this number just for SMS confirmation - $240/ a year ($2400 for ten years) is quite significant. I remember, then back in 2011-2013 when I visited the UK for the first time I bought some travel sim on the street. Orange, or something like that. Paid about $5-10 but used it for nearly two years without top-ups until I physically lost it. If this is still works, than $50-100 for ten years of having the personal  number for SMS sounds like good deal for me. Does anyone know more?

I'm considering extending my visa here but i dont think that 30 days will do much at all when it comes to the countries opening.  

I work online so my income is stable as long as i have internet, and I can afford at most $1,200usd in rent a month, but more like $800 would be nice.

We are both younger and pretty healthy so we aren't too concerned about getting the virus ourselves, but we REALLY don't want to give it to anyone else, because of this we have been self isolating here since we arrived, even before the gov said to do so. And wherever we go we would also self-isolate as much as possible.

It seems Greece will open their borders on July 1st, which is 2 weeks after my visa expires here...but maybe we could do something with that..

We've considered Ireland as well because we've spent time there and enjoyed it, but i think the restrictions are still pretty strong there so it might be complicated in June.

We thought about Sweden but it's just so expensive, but maybe it could work. Same with Iceland.

I think I would prefer to stay away from Mexico and the rest of central and South America for now.

Well that's all changed and I can now work remotely garunteed until December. My lease just ended, I have a small bedroom in a small apartment, not a TON of stuff. Mainly just don't know where to start and what concerns I don't know I should have.

What do I need to know if I wanted to use this time to travel to see nature and have stable internet connection?

My initial fears of taking this step are related to feasibility:

- How much will it cost to get a vehicle to live/work out of. Are there some cool rentals for RVs that make more sense? Or should I just buy one and pay it off and when I'm done rent it out?(Doesn't need to be big or fancy anything will do)

- How will I get reliable strong internet being ""off the grid""? 

- How do I know where I can legally stop and live for a bit? 

- What do I do with all this stuff I've collected over the years? 

- Where do I wash my clothes?

- Are there things I'm not taking into consideration?


I'm thinking maybe just a car will do? Or a tiny small RV.

There's gotta be some way to get internet reliably without cable, right? Haha

I'm sure I can find some RV parks or maybe even parking lots that allow you to sleep in them. Maybe just get a tent and sleeping bag and camp around. 

Gonna Marie Kondo my apartment this weekend, hardcore. See what my base necessities are going to be. Then sell, donate, and ship stuff to parents or put in storage? Unsure of costs there.

Guessing I can just drive into a city/town and use a laundromat.


Hoping for advice and guidance from the digital nomads themselves!!!"
gj41us,3e36c0sq,"Looking for a decent, remote job.","Hello, I'll make it simple.

1) I'm looking for a stable-remote job (full-time).

2) I live in Greece.

3) - I'm a musician. I have a degree in Music from one of the best music colleges in the world. 

\- Finding a stable job in my field is almost impossible.

4) I'm fluent in Greek and English (lived, studied and worked in the US).

5) Skills: I'm a tech savvy guy. I can work with Word, Excel, Premiere, Logic, Photoshop, Illustrator and computers in general. I can type fast, create music(obviously) and videos (I run a youtube channel with 7k subscribers). I'm also the most goal-oriented and driven person I know. I like learning new things and expanding my knowledge.

I'm pretty successful in what I do but not having a stable-safe job is a real burden. My goal is to find a remote job so that I can work on my music and on my business ideas more freely. 

I'm researching extensively. If anyone has an idea on what jobs could work for me, I'd love to hear from you.

thank you"

gjn3ia,1zav66f,Surveyed 892 people to understand how they are coping with sudden remoteness and here's what I found,"Hey everyone!

The question of how COVID-19 has impacted our lives, particularly work-wise, bugged me a few weeks back. So I thought why not ask people about their experience so far.

It took me a little while to prepare the survey itself because I also wanted to consciously include questions about their company and future plans around remote.

Honestly, I was a little overwhelmed and super happy with the response on the survey since it started off as this tiny experiment. Also motivated me to put in additional effort on analysing and presenting the data :)

Put \~2 weeks of effort on this, so super keen to know what you guys think about this? :) I have also put up all the graphs on [this website](https://state-of-work-covid19.remote.tools) for easier viewing.

# Demographics of Respondents

* **Geography**: Majority were from Asia (44%) and North America (34%). Europe constituted about 19% and Africa the least at 3%.
* **Company size**: Respondents were almost equally distributed between startups (<200 employees) at 48% and large companies (500+ employees) at 44%.
* **Function**: As expected (and to be honest, slightly feared :P), individuals in the Engineering function formed a large part of the survey at 33%. The other functions were more equally distributed: Product (12%), Sales (13%), Marketing (12%) and Strategy (14%).

# Insights

**A) Individual’s perspective**

Firstly, what did individuals have to say about themselves:

**1) About half were absolute remote amateurs**

Almost an equal-split in the “remote experience” of individuals. While 54% already had some experience of working remotely, 46% were suddenly finding themselves in unchartered territories. This itself highlights the magnitude of the challenge faced by the workforce today.

&#x200B;

**2) An overwhelming number would like a mix of office & remote work in the future**

Sure, going to office isn’t the happiest thought. However, staying put at home isn’t that great either. Two-thirds stated they would like a mix of the two! About 13% said this way of working has not worked for them at all, with only 20% saying that they would like to continue working fully-remote.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oymgzrhymqy41.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=579e09b608e2c981d2fed2ffdb0e5af61f6f18e4

**3) Productivity has not been severely impacted for most**

The biggest question that I had was how people were coping up with work. Surprisingly, only a paltry 14% said that their productivity was lesser than before. A third said that it has more or less been the same and another third shared that it sort of depends on the day (doesn’t it always 😉).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2e1bezpzmqy41.png?width=938&format=png&auto=webp&s=474afbc0fd696978ce6a498579390a59353d4dd7

**4) Many are working more hours than before**

The picture of remote work being about a person drinking a Pina Colada on a beach is finally being debunked. 32% said that they are consistently working more hours every day! In comparison only 20% said that they are working for lesser hours than before.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n0kvk0i7nqy41.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=56c68afcc2d275224a038441c2b15fe8fba5e104

**5) Work and personal time just can’t be separated OR can they?**

A third of the respondents said that the biggest challenge they have faced is being able to separate “work-time” from “personal-time”. This is totally a genuine problem and needs a concerted effort to solve. Given that both work and personal time now occur in the same place, a conscious demarcation is needed, otherwise, they merge into a continuum.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mrs614g8nqy41.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6a0e6db5f5dc58aa3de540c73078698ee905b47

## B) Company’s perspective

I found the above results quite interesting. But an individual is just one part of the problem or solution. How did companies react to the sudden change?

**1) Two-third companies already had some experience in working remotely**

As can be expected, companies already had at least a partial work-from-home set up available for employees. Therefore, they already had exposure to handling some aspects of remote work. However, a third of the companies are going into this blind, with no prior experience of working remotely in any form.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mkbc90b9nqy41.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6cf636c9c8f75fc566ad19ffd06c64af70de384

**2) Teams have managed to quickly adapt themselves to the new setting**

More than half of the respondents agreed that their team and company didn’t have any prior experience in working remotely. Yet, they were able to quickly set up practices to work successfully. Just about 17% companies were having problems with the remote work set up. This, while quite surprising, is a very encouraging sign!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/urt5uo8anqy41.png?width=976&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc72e31cefd40474f2ac21aed44351cb32094d77

**3) 50% of companies have changed their remote work policies permanently**

In probably the biggest impact for me, \~50% of companies have either started to adopt some aspect of remote working or are further increasing their remote working exposure. This further highlights the fact that remote work might be quite mainstream in a not very distant future.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gneojubbnqy41.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&s=59c2a24a553efa80b396c2fee61372a020f40e30

**4) Companies have learnt to be better prepared for such situations**

54% of companies have taken a concerted effort to be prepared for any such future situations. Employees have been communicated about the associated measures. Worryingly, 24% of companies have not taken any such measures. This is surely the time to analyze and make systemic changes in the company 😕

Will we see a 2, 3, 4 fold increase in jobs where remote work is allowed? More? And how much do you think people with prior experience living and working that way will have a leg up on the competition for new and desirable remote work roles? It's just, this looks like it will be a MASSIVE shift in how work, well, works, and getting your head the potential changes is an interesting exercise and helps prep for the future."

gkcqux,yzyg9,American hoping to continue DN lifestyle with Mexican girlfriend,"I've been a digital nomad since 2011, preferring lengthier stays over country hopping: 1 year New Zealand, 2 years Quebec, 2 years France, 3 months Colombia, 2 years Mexico, etc.  

A little over a year ago I met a great girl here in Mexico and the relationship is going very well.  She's never left Mexico, but has expressed interest in living/traveling abroad.  We're also in the process of getting her started in her own online business so she can work on the road (like I've been able to), and she's showing solid progress after 3 months.

Europe has always been my favorite and I've begun research into areas that would be possible to settle long-term.  I've looked at a couple options that grant residency with a small real estate purchase (think 50k-150k USD) and come back with results mostly in the Balkans like Serbia, Bosnia, Albania, etc. as well as Georgia (not in Europe obv but another option).  The Baltic countries could be an option, but I think the weather would be too difficult an adjustment for her.  We might also try for a self employment visa like the one in Spain, provided she can get to the point where she's earning enough to qualify.  It would also be the easiest transition as we both speak Spanish.

So my main question is about the racial aspect.  She's a dark skinned Mexican and I was curious if she would experience any undue racial discrimination in any of the areas we're considering?  Are there any countries more notable for their tolerance/intolerance than the others in the group?  Or maybe this would be a nonissue.  

The second question is if there are any countries in Europe or near Europe that are more lenient towards Mexican citizens?  I was thinking that it might be better for us to get married before undertaking the process of securing a lengthy visa or residence options.  We probably wouldn't get started as a DN couple for another year to year and a half, so there would be plenty of time to get everything sorted.

Thanks for any insight you can offer!"

gkor0p,ing8d,Digital nomads: how do you keep up with friends and family,"A bit of background: I (30F) was an international art teacher for 3 years, taught in China and Italy. I realized that some fellow teachers were having a hard time seeing family back home because of low salary. Most of my friends and family are in the Bay Area, CA, a HCOL area; if I ever wanted to come back here I better make sure I was financially able to. At this point I had just started feeling like I made some true friends after 2 years in Italy, but I decided that this career path was adventurous but not sustainable.  I came back here, transitioned into UX design, and deepened my relationship with my family and friends, dreaming about a day I could go remote. 

Lo and behold my company has granted full remote work permanently to my entire team during this covid-19 crisis. Ironically I have nowhere I would travel right now. But also, the friends I’ve made here after 3 years are exactly the types of bonds I was searching for in Italy.  It was pretty lonely landing in a new country, and I think it would be doubly so now that I just work remote without the support of a school and colleagues. I want to know how you all manage relationships while traveling around. Do you have a home base? Do you have a partner? Do you adopt a country for an extended period of time? Do you fly home every few months?

In my 20s, I values adventure, but now I’m valuing relationships, and I want to find a way to deepen them but not always be tied down in one place. Is that possible? Plus, all this traveling and I never focused on relationships, and now I think I’m ready to find a life partner, but I worry that I won’t ever find one if I keep moving around. Any single digital nomads who can share their dating life details?

TLDR; granted 100% remote work, have doubts about keeping lasting relationships if I move around from past experiences, especially in the dating department."
gkp164,3upqr,Digital Nomads: Is there a better service than PayPal?,"I'm working with international clients, and a lot of them want to pay via PayPal, which would normally be fine, except PayPal is a joke and likes to gouge you on both ends of the spectrum. 

Today I got paid $423 USD and needed to make a 384 Euro purchase. No worries I thought, the exchange rate would put my USD at 390 EUR, so should be fine.

Except that wasn't the case, and instead gave me 380 Euro.

Okay, I think. I'm 4 Euro short of what I need, it will just take the rest from my bank account in local currency and convert it, right? right?

No. That would make sense. Instead somehow 384 euro (for purchasing) is 673 AUD through paypal, but the 380 Euro I have in my account apparently only is worth 613 AUD despite literally [both ends being PayPal](https://imgur.com/a/QLa5shm)

Amusingly, before I used Paypal to convert my USD into Euro directly, the 384 Euro was going to be 711 AUD. In the end I had to get a friend to shoot me some PayPal funds, that I then changed to Euro. So instead of it costing me 711 AUD or 673 AUD (both rates, again, shown by PayPal) it cost me what Paypal equivalents to 620 AUD.

Paypal is clearly pocketing this difference and apparently this isn't fraudulent at all, so.... there is that. 

Is there a service that lets me get rid of this ridiculous system? It's absolutely insane to me, and is costing me tonnes of money over time."
gkvz0s,5my7apoc,"I feel lonely. Are there places to live where people are encouraged to leave their flats, meet new people, interact, do things together in the common space?","The modern human way of living feels so lonely. Just a bunch of buildings one next to the other where you rent or buy a flat and stay confined in your own loneliness. I've been working remotely since I left college about 5 years ago. Moved away, lost touch with ""close people"". Now all my friends are virtual. I don't exactly blame remote working, I love it, but I guess I didn't anticipate the loneliness effects it'd have on me. I've been looking for a place to live where I can meet new people. Where people are encouraged to leave and interact in common areas, chat, play sports, boardgames, videogames, eat pizza, watch stuff together, laugh. I was thinking in something sort of like a big apartment complex with a lot of common areas, theaters, I don't know. Sort of like a college without the college? I really don't know. Perhaps I'll become a digital nomad for a while, try to find my place. Are there even places like that? What am I looking for?

gkw5c7,ilywiy1,Short-term digital nomad working for American Company in Germany (visa and health insurance) question,"My best friend lives in Germany and I've always wanted to visit her hometown for an extended period of time (just under 90 days within a 180 day period). I work for an American company as a US citizen, and my company does not do any work in Germany or for Germany. My company will allow not allow me to take some three-month sabbatical so I can visit my friend. Frankly, I'm not sure they'll allow me to go at all. But I want to approach my manager with the idea of letting me work remotely from Germany during that 90-day period.

The goal would be to work 40 hours + a week, but to sightsee on the weekends and explore my best friend's home town.

Maybe I'm ignorant (I want to be but am not a digital nomad), but I didn't think there would be any issue or any tax obligation associated with this.  I thought I would go on a tourist visa (since I'm a US citizen) and work remotely for my American company for 8ish hours a day. Then go enjoy my weekends. But I've asked this question in a couple of places, and most people are saying it's either illegal or legally ""gray"", neither of which appeal to me.

I plan on calling a Germany Embassy (or writing, because then I can have a paper trail), but I'm not sure how easy it will be to get a hold of someone there.

So I was wondering if anyone had experience with a similar situation in the Schengen area, or how digital nomads go about living and working in places for short periods of time.

I know Germany has various Visas, but I can't tell which one fits my situation. I'm also doubting that the time-frame would work out. Given my friend's and my individual situations, this would have to happen before December of this year.

My work would not sponsor any kind of Visa. I don't make enough to pay taxes and health care in two countries (I thought on a tourist Visa, I could use the travel health care one of my credit card companies gives out, but on another Visa, I'd had to then pay health care in two countries, which I can't afford, especially if I'm being double taxed). I also agreed to give my friend money to cover rent and utilities.

But I was just curious, because I know there are people who have managed to figure this out, and I'm wondering how."

Places are now open including domestic flights and attractions. Since I was a bit tired of a big city life here in HCMC, I decided to go for a one week vocation to Phu Quoc island.

I thought I would share the experience with the community.

Travel:

\- You need to fill in one medical form ([https://tokhaiyte.vn/](https://tokhaiyte.vn/)) each way, QR code is enough.

\- I used both Vietnamese Airlines and Bamboo without issue (VNA had a little delay).

\- Only one out of two ways people cared to look and only one out of two hotels cared to request this form.

\- People need to wear masks on the plane although not everybody seem to follow 100% of the time.

\- I booked the flights with Baolau.com, seems to offer the cheapest deals for Vietnam now. We paid 1500k dong per person for return ticket.

Phu Quoc

\- Avoid the beautiful south east, there is only one luxurious resort, and you won't be able to even go to the bar (we tried). Next to it is a military base so even thought things looks connected on the map, it's all closed area.

\- In the south there is a port that can take you to other smaller islands, some boat trips are running. Cable car was running as well.

\- Instead go north to the ""star beach"". You can see starfish and have excellent lunch, coffee, relax there. Or visit Sao beach on the east side, the nicest beach on the island.

\- Scooters rental 120-250k dong per day (24-hours), good condition. Hotels will arrange it for you.

\- Many hotels are closed and the ones opened might be in some sort of partial-reopening. Our original hotel had a construction next to it and closed both restaurant and bar! Told us to go 25 minutes to the city for eating. It was a mistake to only ask about the pool being opened. Ask on restaurants, bars, noise, everything that crosses your mind.

\- Luckily they gave us immediate refund and we found ourselves in Eco Beach, a beautiful place that also had the restaurant closed, but would cook for us all meals with advanced booking. It was a real private experience. I had the beach and pool to myself. We dined alone on the terrasse next to the sea. Their cook is really good, had one of the best fish soups in my life! Very friendly and acceptable prices (1k dong per night, meals \~200k).

\- Next we moved on to SOL by Melida, a bit more pricy alternative (but with one out of two restaurants fully running). The beach was a little better, pool with a wet bar. A bit slower service overall and laundry was 600k dong! (in promotion! not including tax and service tax.... oh my and we did need laundry hah).

\- Practically nobody wore masks on the whole island which I found really refreshing (I needed a mask break!)

Any other questions?"

gmnld9,1zav66f,The Remote Worker's Bill of Rights,"Hey everyone!

The following is a short piece I wrote for my [newsletter](https://www.remote.tools/newsletter). Would love to hear what you guys think :)

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You've surely heard of Jeff Atwood. If not, he's the co-founder of StackOverflow, StackExchange, Discourse and runs a super popular blog by the name 'Coding Horror'. Long story short, he's well-known in the programming world.

I love reading his posts occasionally (if you're interested, here's a [handpicked list](https://gist.github.com/tssm/7789984) and the one on [programmer's bill of rights](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-programmers-bill-of-rights) (published long back, in 2006) particularly inspired me to write a similar one on remote work. Of course, there's no better time to do this than now, given we are witnessing a major turning point in the history of remote work.

## Setting the context right

The Bill of Rights, as the name suggests, is a list of essentials every remote worker should possess. And it is the collective responsibility of the company and its employees to ensure that these rights are met. So if your company doesn't mandate and provide for it, you should surely take it up with your manager. At the same time, if you lead a team or run your own company, you should ensure these rights are met for every single employee.

What happens if you do so? Better remote working conditions ⇒ Improved productivity ⇒ Happier employees and success at work!

A quick disclaimer though - There are always exceptions (triggered in exceptional situations 😉) and it is fine as long as they occur rarely. For example, having an emergency or war-room meeting at an untimely hour in one or more timezones is alright on rare occasions (say, your primary service faces a sudden outage).

## The Remote Worker's Bill of Rights

**1. Every remote worker shall have a fast and reliable internet connection**

Most of us already have a decent, working internet connection at home. However, individuals must have access to business-class internet and employers must provide for this. Fiber connection with minimal outages is ideal.

**2. Every remote worker shall have an alternative or backup internet connection**

It is naive to assume that there will no interruptions in your internet connection, even if it is the best in class. Hence, every individual must have a fallback, arranged on his/ her own.

**3. Every remote worker shall have a workstation of their choice at home**

Again, employers must provide for this. Bonus points for trendy or creative workstations e.g. treadmill desks. Also, having a comfortable chair is as important as a well thought out desk.

**4. Every remote worker shall have quiet working conditions**

To achieve peak productivity, every individual needs focussed concentration and at least one bout of deep work in a day. At an individual level, having a dedicated workstation in a quiet corner of the house helps achieve this. At the same time, remote teams must have protocols in place for individuals to achieve this e.g. ability to snooze off all notifications or indicate in some other way that you are busy right now.

**5. Every remote worker shall have the option to turn down a meeting at an untimely hour in their timezone**

Ideally, meetings should be scheduled such that they align during the working hours across all timezones (of employees). However, this might get tricky at times. So, it is best to have red zones (of time ranges) to never schedule a meeting. For example, meetings between 10PM-6AM in any timezone can be made optional.

**6. Every remote worker shall have an agenda shared (or distributed) before every meeting**

Bonus points for also mandating MoMs or action points after every meeting.

**7. Every remote worker shall have a stipend associated with social interaction**

Be it a pass for a nearby co-working space or a conference happening in the town or even a quarterly meet-up with your team, companies must provide for such perks. This actively encourages human interaction and tackles the most pertinent problem of remote working - loneliness or social isolation.

**8. Every remote worker must be made capable of finding and effectively using emojis, memes and GIFs (bonus points for associating rewards with this)**

You will find lots and lots of people vouching for the fact that use of emojis leads to better communication and overall, sets the right mood in remote communication. We, of course abide by that too."

gmtglh,fwbz2nn,[Warning] SafetyWing insurance provider not responding to claim from two months ago,"I'll do my best to keep this post less ""ranty"" and more to the point. I know many people on this sub have been keeping an eye on SafetyWing to see if it's worth buying Travel Insurance from them since they are very new.

**TL;DR**: SafetyWing's insurance provider is not responding to my Political Evacuation claim from two months ago during the beginning of the pandemic. They are lying and claiming they never received my original claim even though I provided proof.

On March 19, 2020, I contacted HCCMIS (SafetyWing insurance provider) and told them I was leaving Portugal to go back to my home country because of the pandemic. This is covered under ""Political Evacuation"" in SafetyWing's policy. I followed all the fine print including contacting the insurance provider to receive instructions. The customer service rep told me just to buy a flight home and fill out a claim online.

I bought my ticket which cost about $800 out of pocket. This was the most economical price of a ticket at the time due to the myriad of flights being canceled every day. I filled out a form online with the directions on their website. **The claim form was signed, completed, and submitted March 19, 2020.**

Last week I sent an email to HCCMIS asking about the status of my claim. At this point it had been 39 business days and it is supposed to take 30-45 business days to complete. They responded with something along the lines of ""We can't find your claim"".

I forwarded the email from DocuSign saying the form was completed and submitted on March 19, 2020. About five days later (this morning), I got an email back saying that I didn't properly submit the document and they never received it. I knew this was fishy because the DocuSign form automatically submits upon completion.

After about 15 seconds of investigation I found that they were lying. DocuSign has a feature that shows all history of the document including *when* and *who* it was sent to. Of course, on March 19, 2020, the document was sent to [claims@hccmis.com](mailto:claims@hccmis.com).

I sent them the full history of the document in an email. Today's (May 19, 2020) response: ""I have sent your claim for processing. Please allow 30-45 business days for processing."" If they just now submitted my claim, it will likely be denied since you must submit a Political Evacuation claim within 10 days of the CDC issuing a Level 3/4 travel advisory.

**HCCMIS was blatantly caught lying and ignored my claim**. I will not be returning to SafetyWing or any Travel Insurance company with HCCMIS as a provider. I would strongly urge against anyone trusting them in the risk that a more serious and expensive claim could be ignored.

Safe travels everyone ✌️

**Update**: My claim was expedited and processed on June 1 and I received my money from HCCMIS. Someone from SafetyWing reached out to me after they saw this post and was able to get HCCMIS to expedite my claim. The support I received from SafetyWing was much more professional and helpful than HCCMIS."
gn5210,4yzjod0q,What are the best countries for Tax Residency and Business Setup for European Digital Nomad,"Hi all, I'm originally from Denmark, but have been traveling non-stop for the past 5 years working freelance for a client in the UK and doing a little bit of affiliate marketing. I am no longer a Danish resident (only citizen) and don't have any ties to Denmark.

In order to establish a bit more of a permanent base I'm looking for a place to establish tax residency and setup a company. These doesn't necessarily have to be done in the same country as there may be some benefits to establishing residency in one country and setting up a company in another country.

I prefer to stay within Asia or Europe (including Eastern Europe) if possible. Below are some of the countries I am considering at the moment, but I am sure there are other, maybe better, options but I don't know enough about this to pick one over the other or to decide on where to incorporate and where to establish residency etc.

So, I would love to hear from some of the brilliant people here if you have any thoughts on this? If you have already setup your company / tax residency somewhere I would love to hear about your experience ans tips.

Countries I am considering/have heard good things about:

\- **Georgia**: I could qualify as a small business individual entrepreneur with 1% tax rate. While the 1% tax rate is very attractive the problem with this is that it is not a corporate structure and doesn't offer the protection that a corporation does. To set up an LLC in Georgia the tax would be 20% I believe, but I think there might be a way to set up tax residency in Georgia and company in another country as I have read that Georgia doesn't tax foreign sourced income?

\- **Bulgaria**: I don't know that much about Bulgaria but from what I understand both corporate tax and personal income tax is 10%? Not sure if/how foreign sourced income is taxed.

\- **Cyprus/Malta:** Heard these countries mentioned positively, but don't know anything about the tax and residency there.

Before all the comments saying that I should talk to an accountant etc. Yes, thank you that is great advise and I certainly will do that before I go any further, but for now I'm just trying to work out the best options and then I will contact local accountants in each of those places to get professional advise.

Thanks a lot :)"

gni6gz,wkfp8,General European freelancer/work visa question.,"I’ve been looking into the German freelancer visa, which I think actually might also be known as the Berlin artist visa (? Or maybe those are two different things)

But I know this German freelancer visa can last anywhere from 1 to 3 years and you can renew it each time. I think without having to go home

I am an American – I was looking at potential freelancer visas in other countries like maybe France and Portugal -  are these freelancer visas maxed out at one year?/And would I have to go back to the United States to reapply every time?

For an American, aside from this German freelancer visa I think the Dutch American free trade agreement is probably the best set up but for whatever reason, I’m not super keen on the Netherlands right now. No real reason

So, are there any other freelancer visas in Europe were you can stay from anywhere from 1 to 3 years, renew your visa and not technically have to reapply in your home country?

Thank you"

Buenos Aires sounds totally exciting for me. But there has been a lot of fluctuations and debate on the cost of living in Buenos Aires, especially about accommodation. I would earn in USD.

goj12u,143qs2,My laptop was stolen in Medellin *sharing tips to secure your gear,"So a few months a guy stole my bag in a coworking space in Medellin, Colombia. I lost $7K USD in an instant. I was news because the word went around the city and also in the digital nomad community to a point, that people donated to help me.

The full story is on [a video that I've just published.](https://youtu.be/4I6MW69aQls)

*TL:DR for the video: I was in a DN meetup shooting the event, guy took my stuff, coworking had cameras, trying to track but nothing. Went to police but everything was lost.. Then a gofundme page. And got everything back now. Full disclosure it was 99% my fault, not blaming anyone else.*

In this post let me just share you, from the lessons learned, some tips on how to secure your gear before traveling.‍

* **Pay your gear with credit card.** Most credit cards companies have their own insurance for losses and as they track all of your purchases, it's always good to have them as a backup.‍
* **Activate Find My on all your devices.** This is an advice for all Apple advices, but make sure you have them all set up before traveling. If you have internet connection while stolen, you might be able to find your device right away. If not, at least you can block the device so no one else can use it.
* **Add AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss for iPhone.** Not everyone knows that the iPhone now has the add-on for losses by buying an small fee to get a new phone.
* **Register your products.** Most gear companies have an account website platform where you can register your device with their serial number. If someone tries to sell your gear and you find out, you can use this to back it up and confirm it was yours all along.
* **Have a tracking device like Tile.** Add an small device that you can track all your stuff (have it inside your backpack) so you can find your stolen stuff easily.
* **Have an travel insurance with electronics included.** Travel insurance are mostly about health but you can add the electronics for an extra fee and at least, better peace of mind.

There you go. What do you guys think... anyone other tip to take to be safe with your gear?"

tl;dr

A curious 21 y/o who has an excellent job asks about the digital nomad life of people who are living it

—————

21. Just a brief background:

1) I graduated in March 2019
2) I started my first job in August 2019
3) I am a project-based employee

—-quite a long read—-

I am a degree holder of an Aviation-related study with specialization in Information Technology. I took this path because my passion is in Aeronautics/Astronautics but I have a huge interest in IT. And yep, I aspire to become an Astronaut/Cosmonaut someday. 

I have solo-travelled two countries before; Singapore and Thailand. In Singapore, the plane tickets were a graduation gift from my parents because I was bound to attend an international job fair/summit for IT people and seek for Universities where I would later plan to study for my Master’s. It was a week after I graduated so I had not really prepared much but I brought with me my CV to hopefully find a job that would suit my skills. Honestly, I enjoyed my stay such that I ended up exploring the city and setting aside both purposes of my travel. It was a gift to also celebrate anyway. 

I arrived back to our home and quickly told my parents that I would plan to spend the next couple of months resting from school education and preparing for the real world. I kept thinking about when and where would I next travel, and by what means would I be able to make it happen. 

I needed to have a job but I heavily considered studying for Master’s to bid for a higher salary but without years of experience, I thought it to be improbable. My parents have always been supportive to whatever we want to do in life which I am thankful of til now. 

Luckily, I got a job interview in July 2019, was accepted and started officially in August the same year. It was and is still a great job for me! It’s in the field of Space, I get to practice my IT skills, we get to attend various workshops and lectures  that are essential to our work, it is a regular 9-5 work but we have no time cards so no one tracks your in-and-outs but better to work in reasonable hours whether in the place or at home unless you’re done with the deliverables, can arrange work from home when no laboratory works, holidays for students are our holidays as well. Work-related travels are also funded by the project (I’ve been part of this for several times already). On top of it, it pays above the normal starting rate for a fresh grad employee. It’s a good choice and a starting point for me.

I can say that ever since I got into this job, I’ve always felt somehow like a digital nomad. I sometimes work the entire day using my laptop even though a PC is provided. I also accept part time works from friends which I insert on doing at my cubicle when I have light deliverables. After work, I regularly play sports, sometimes with my colleagues, but mostly with the sport club that I am part of. We also go for night outs. I haven’t really felt like a professional because of my work ethic. Haha but it’s all good. I am happy to find the balance between work and life. This work earned me to self-fund my travel in Bangkok last Christmas.

Plan is to study abroad next year with the money that I will be earning for the coming months and some investments I’ve made with our family business, and when I become successful with my studies (I am claiming it), I’ll then look for a remote-working job that would allow me to work and travel at the same time. 

Right now, I run my own CMS blog site, which was built five years ago, with goal not to generate a passive income but to simply have a portfolio for topics I am interested at. I am currently refreshing myself about SEOs, algorithms and avalanching. I am also still fixing the contents of the site . This pandemic helps me catch up with all the latest trends and tips to become a successful digital nomad soon. 

I wonder what’s a digital nomad has in store for me. I am grateful for the time freedom I have in life now although it’s not as free as becoming an actual digital nomad.

To kind, digital nomad of reddit, please elucidate to me how is your life in reality when compared to my vague understanding of digital nomad.

I hope everyone is safe"

I'm a Belgian business student looking to go fully digital nomad. I currently have some websites that generate affiliate/advertising revenue and I work as a freelancer.

But once I graduate and when I will go digital nomad I will set up a company. Currently I was considering following options:

\- Setting up a company (BV) in my own home country. This is probably the easiest way without complicating stuff (I guess)

\-Setting up a company through e residency in estonia, this is meant for digital nomads I heard but I read some things about tax residency that makes it more complicated, but if you're a digital nomad you probably won't have that problem right? This is also the tax friendliest solution.

\-corporation in USA, lots of resources, good banking and I want to move to the USA later in the long term (after being digital nomad).

He invited me to Bali with him and a few other friends later in the year once travel restrictions calm down (hopefully). The idea is to have a bunch of us relaxing and surfing every day while working remotely from over there. I personally run my agency remotely so, of course I wouldn't be going if I couldn't support myself. I know time difference can be a headache, but it's a price to pay for the experience.

I've never been to Bali, but I've always wanted to go under these circumstances.

I would love to hear about anyone else's experience with living and working remotely in Bali. I hear cost of living is super cheap - how much were you spending for what type of living situation?

I plan on living a high quality of life while I'm there, even if it means I'll be spending a bit more.

grgzrp,chdzrt9,"With Couchsurfing becoming a paid service, how am I going to meet new people (when things go back to normal)?","I just found out they built a paywall behind Couchsurfing which effectively kills it. Or at least the non-hosting aspect of it.

As a solo traveler the social aspect of the digital nomad experience is 70% of the whole deal. 

Facebook groups and events or Meetup never worked for me. They are much more uncommon and target a only a specific activity or demographic group. They don't have the casual component to it meeting people up for a beer via Couchsufing hangouts had.

grkqve,18stst7r,"International Health Insurance - established (Cigna, Allianz, IMG et al) vs niche (Safety Wing et al) players; am I missing something/someone and how to compare effectively?","Hello community,

I am a dual citizen (US/Germany), male, single, 40yo who's transitioning out of a corporate job with health insurance into the freelance and nomad life. I have primary residence in California, US but expect to split my time in thirds between the US, Germany and South East Asia (VN, CN, HK, SGP, TH, IN) over the next years to come.

I am generally very healthy and active, have just completed a set of checkups and blood tests without issues, have no preconditions and take no active medication. 

I researched the international/expat health insurance plan as primary health insurance (not a travel insurance) and found the market to be very confusing. On the one hand you seem to have the established big players like Cigna, Allianz, IMG, Bupa, AETNA, William Russel, HCI and similar chasing your business and on the other one some more new-age digital nomad focused players like Safety Wing, WeExpats, Insure Nomads.

Overall its very hard to get quotes that you can compare 1:1, policies are very complex and exhaustive so overall I have struggled to come to any conclusions/deductions; with a solid self contribution in form of deductibles  the rates with the big players seem to run between $150 and $350 / month and with the ""new age"" players between $250 and $400 primarily with the value proposition of having some safety net if a major disease hits (i.e. cancer, major accident etc). Also the degree of support in the US varies quite a bit between the policies.

My questions to this community:

* Are there any players I have been missing out on in my list I should consider? I favor new digital players focused on an expat lifestyle vs the older bureaucratic providers; e.g. I have been happy with Lemonade as my rental insurance provider 
* Are there any key differentiation elements that usually a very differentiated between the policies and I should watch out for outside of premium, in-patient, out-patient, waiting period, US support and notice period? Something that may not be super obvious in person?
* My understanding is that generally there are no legal requirements for me to hold any health insurance; do the premiums usually provide enough value vs going without? I understand this is subjective and based on your risk tolerance but open to get ppl's opinion.
* Anyone wanting to share endorsements/warnings on any players based on their experience?

Thanks a lot in advance; if I can share more detail please do not hesitate to ask."

gvv2q2,ym9df,Estonia's Parliament has approved the creation of the world's first digital nomad visa. It becomes law on 1 July.,"The news is translated from Estonian Interior ministry website. 

Today, the Riigikogu approved the amendments concerning the diginomate visa, according to which Estonia will be the first country in Europe and one of the first countries in the world to create a diginomate visa. The visa of an Estonian diginomate allows you to come to Estonia, stay here as a tourist and at the same time continue working for a foreign employer or as a freelancer regardless of location.

&#x200B;

Digital wrestling is a way of life that allows you to combine traveling around the world and teleworking over the Internet. The main activities of diginomats are information and communication technology, finance and marketing.

&#x200B;

“A diginomate visa strengthens Estonia's image as an e-state and thus enables Estonia to have a more effective say on an international scale. It also contributes to the export of Estonian e-solutions, which is especially important in recovering from the current economic crisis, ""said Mart Helme.

&#x200B;

Estonia, as a country known for its innovative technological solutions, is an attractive destination country for digital nomads on an international scale. Diginomats create significant added value for Estonia in the long run, as they diversify the Estonian ICT community and at the same time consume local goods and services and have a positive impact on local business.

&#x200B;

The Minister added that the general conditions for issuing visas to diginomats apply and that minimizing the risks of misuse was also taken into account when developing the changes. No diginomat is entitled to a visa and their background is checked as carefully as for other visa applicants.

&#x200B;

As diginomats do not fit under the rules of classical work, this prevents them from coming to Estonia and choosing a purposeful basis for staying in Estonia. In the case of Estonia, diginomats find the Estonian startup ecosystem, access to the European Union market, high level of English language skills as well as the e-residency program attractive.

&#x200B;

The Diginomat Visa Program will be implemented gradually. In the first stage, foreigners who prove themselves that they are diginomats can apply for a visa. In the future, solutions are being developed that will enable the integration of other Estonian e-government solutions, especially e-residency, with the diginomate visa. The program offered by a reliable service provider is planned in the future. According to preliminary estimates, a maximum of around 1,800 people per year could apply for a diginomate visa.

The tripod is actually made for cameras, but I love how compact it goes, can handle enough weight and can expand up to 10"" in therefore it goes high enough to be at the same eye-level with the Macbook.

Then the tripod mount is the smallest I've found that can also goes compact and can take any iPad from 10 to 12.9 (not sure about the largest iPad but seems doable).

The trains also offer spectacular views even on ordinary day journeys, for example, the one from Austria to Zurich.

Looking for fellow Digital Nomads to share their experiences of traveling/being in Europe right now.

\- is it feasible? are Trains running as per normal?

\- are Cafes open? or is it a lockdown in most of Europe?

\-what is the public sentiment like? My brother who is in the UK said people are wondering about the streets as if it's normal...

if it helps, I'm looking to do more of northern Europe / Scandinavian countries then work my way towards central and south-eastern Europe.

We'll likely have 4 connected devices (2 phones + 2 GPS tracking watches for the kids). All of these devices will need to have independent cell data connections, can't rely on one connected device tethering to the others. For the phones, I can't see us needing much more than 2-3GB/month. The bulk data usage will be when we have access to free wifi, the cell data mostly for maps, messages, and other low data consumption purposes outside the free wifi areas. Likely need voice + data for the phones, and data only for the GPS watches.

Looking for some advice/recommendations on international SIM providers, services such as [travelsim.com](https://travelsim.com/) or [worldsim.com](https://worldsim.com/). We're Canadian, so don't have access to most of the US based plans unfortunately. I know most recommendations are to simply pick up a local SIM card upon arrival as these provide the cheapest rates, and this is likely fine for travelling solo, but these inconveniences become amplified when travelling with kids. I don't want to be swapping out 4 SIM cards every time we move around, and dealing with different plans and payment options each time. A solution that provides multiple users under one account, and the ability to manage and add funds as needed would be ideal. I understand this will come at a cost premium as opposed to local SIM's.

I started living a digital nomad life style earlier this year driven by a family health event that required me to resign from a full time job for care taking and leave my home in the USA, Los Angeles.

Facts about me:

* Single/M/40
* US and German citizenship
* Primary residence currently registered to a place i own and rent out in Los Angeles, CA, USA
* Actual residence ratio projected for 2020: 30% Germany, 40% Misc Asia, 30% US
* I conduct consulting and online publishing business under an LLC based in Los Angeles, CA, USA; LLC yearly income is low 6 digits US$

Tax status:

* The last years I have been filing taxes in the US, California given my natural residence there and employment status
* I filed the LLC as sole proprietary
* I am not making any advance tax payments on my LLC in coordination with my CPA; I did pay the $800 LLC fee for 202 

Outlook:

* I have no immediate plans to return to the US, California but intend to keep my place rented for the next 18-24 months
* My clients do not really care where my business is operated out of or if there would be a change to the business name

Misc:

* No US-based health insurance; my payments and affiliations within the US are primarily mortgage,  HOA, insurance, utilities  

Questions:

* Given the above is there a more recommended approach to my tax status and corporate setup? From my research it seems there could be an avenue to 
   * a/ incorporate in a Asian-based country and build a primary residence there 
   * b/ register a mailbox address outside of CA with the IRS
* Does it make sense to make this shift immediately or would you not touch things for 2020?
* Any considerations when going about this upon my return to the US and potential complications getting back into ""the system""?

I’m planning on going to Croatia mid August for a 2/3 months.

h7eu8y,mdvn3,Canadian - Traveling internationally - banking options,"HI,

Couldn't find any recent posts on this so I hope I'm not re asking a common question.

I'm from Canada, and going traveling for about a year with my wife. We both have Canadian jobs (work online), and trying to figure out the bets way to pay for things internationally. 

1. Visa/Master card with low exchange fees. Scoctiabank passport Visa infinite, & HSBC World Elite.
2. Debit card with low exchange fees. HSBC & Scotiabank seems to come up a lot as a good options.
3. other?

HSBC & Scotiabank seems to come up a lot as a good options, what other intentional banks work for Canadians? 

One big issue I see is that getting your card canceled or frozen abroad. I've traveled and had my visa put on hold, then put back into operation over the phone, however it seems like banks won't do that with Debit cards. I want to have back ups of backups, first Debit, second Visa, third Transferwise?

Any other issues/options I should be considering?

I am currently based in London, UK. I am about to initiate conversations for a job that, while ""London based"" it is fully remote, something that at the moment looks extremely attractive as I have a long distance relationship with a girl from another country.

My simple, quick question is, while of course never fully settling and residing in a different country (I know this cannot be done due to Visa/residency/tax reasons), is there something that impedes me (legally or company wise (i know this varies from company to company, but perhaps there is a general consensus)) from spending long-ish periods of time (say 1 or 2 months) abroad?

h9pwth,16y5cj,What's the best way to get a remote position or temporary work contract with an American IT company?,"I am European, starting in IT and would like to know what's the best way to land a remote permanent position or, better yet, a temporary on site project for a couple of months (like 6 months for example) with an American company. This last idea would be sort of cool, I think I'd like to live in the US for like 6 months, make money and then spend the rest of the year travelling and come back the next year to a different american city. I think I'd enjoy the experience. 

I believe my level of experience and knowledge is still very low for me to be considered a high value employee and be able to make the demands I want, so I am interested to know what I should do in the next 2-3 years to achieve that goal. Also, for the temporary contract position, I'd need visa sponsoring so it's important to take into account the salary they'd pay me would be lower than what they'd usually pay, especially if I am too green. 

My academic background is not on IT, I studied pharmaceutical sciences. I have a 3 month bootcamp in web development, have a job in automatic testing, so I write some code but nonethless, I am currently not a developer (let's see how things go in the next couple of months). I will enroll in an online bachelor program in computer science, this Fall. I saw some interesting fully online programs from American universities and also from british and australian universities but they are way too expensive, so I opted for one in my country. 

I am bit frustrated that it will take very long for me to finish the bachelor. I can't quit my full time job and study full time (and honestly that'd probably be a waste of time because I wouldn't be acquiring any professional experience if I studied full time and I am not 22 yo anymore) and I will only be able to do part time, so if the course is usually 3 years, it will take me 6 years. 
So yeah, I don't want to spend 6 years working full time and studying part time and having to wait that whole time to get my dream job that will allow me to travel the world and don't starve in the process. 

So suggestions to speed up my path into nomading or at least semi-nomading/half-nomading are welcome."

My company is very likely going to return to full work from home after a haphazard attempt to get us all back in the office.  If they do this, I was hoping instead of working from home, to work from a beach somewhere and I'm not sure where exactly and was hoping people here might have some recommendations.

I was thinking down in the Caribbean somewhere.  I'm looking for a good mix of affordable and safe.  I'm single with no kids.  I'd just like a view of the ocean while I work and to be able to enjoy the ocean when not working.  I like to SCUBA dive so cool dive sites in the area would be ideal.

The only real considerations I have are that I'll need a place that is open for tourist visitors without overly onerous restrictions (i.e., I wouldn't want to self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival but things like temperature checks and masks are very reasonable) and has regularly scheduled flights back to the U.S.  For work the only things I need are to be within an hour or so +/- of US Central Time and I need a strong and stable internet connection.

If I relocate to a country that has low taxation and is cheap, then my net income will be more than double, and I can save at least 3x compared to now (I live in Sweden now)... Financial independence in the next 3 to 5 years is no more a dream!

Now I have to decide where to start this new adventure. My main requirements are:  
\- fast and reliable internet (I work in tech and also need daily video conferencing with my new team)  
\-great weather  
\-running friendly ( don't want to be limited to just running on the streets)  
\- able to get by in English  
\- safety  
\- reasonable tax  
\- easy to get the required permits to settle there (my plan is to start around September)

\- friendly people (warm culture)  
\-good dating opportunity (not just women who want to use me for my money, either directly or indirectly). I also wouldn't mind starting a family if I meet the right person.  


South America or east Asia comes to mind.

Any place you recommend?  


Have lived in Tokyo for a year and I loved it, but expensive and just too many people. Also, running in Tokyo was boring as hell, it was a concrete jungle, I was sometimes commuting for an hour to find some nice routes. And i don't think it's straight forward to get work permit as a consultant ..  


I will never consider China and Hong Kong. Been there several times, I just don't like the vibe and the culture there...and the air quality in China, I have been there about 7 times, different cities, didn't see the sun at all!  


Taiwan, I liked, but not as cheap. And maybe I was there at the wrong season, the humidity was unbearable.  


Thailand, I liked it as well. But also too humid, and I am a recovering sex addict...me moving to Thailand will be like a recovering alcoholic becoming a bartender..

South America, only been to Argentina. Language was a big issue there. And not sure if I am ready to learn a new language. But so many beautiful places, maybe worth learning Spanish just for that. Also only an hour or two hrs time difference from US.  


PS. I am black. And unfortunately, I have noticed that it matters a lot in almost all places that I have lived or visited.  That is also one of the reasons, apart from financial motivations, that I want to leave Sweden. Though I have not experienced any racism at work, and any open racism anywhere else in Sweden, but in my personal life, I am tired of jumping one hoop after another in order to prove that I am OK, specially whenever I meet new people, once they figure out I am an African (African Americans, from what I heard, have a completely different experience). I have to somehow indicate that ""No, I am not a refugee, I have actually been paying taxes since the first day I came here. No, I am not dangerous, I have never been in a fight since elementary school. No, I do not have a 10 inch penis."" ...you see, even when it is ""positive"" it is demeaning like being asked ""do you really have a BBC?"", people using you as virtue signalling by befriending you or dating you. I had experienced that so many times, I am now suspicious whenever a white person is open to me for friendship or romance, even when I am the one who initiated the interaction! Yeah, I am now putting everyone else in a box as well. It would be a shame if I am to repeat all that in another country/continent.."

My preference would be to head to Portugal but I've not been able to find any viable flights there from the middle of the UK (outside London airports). I'm therefore looking at options to get from Spain to Portugal, if the Spain vibe is generally going to be anti-tourist. I was thinking about a fast train to Madrid and then getting from Madrid to Porto or Lisbon overland (which I imagine should be relatively easy?).

Also, if any folks are around in Spain, I'd generally be down, movements permitting, for meeting up for coffee/beer/walking around.

It wasn't easy, but they trusted me enough to let me on board even though I have 0 professional experience in a team. Tbh it kinda scares me, but challenge accepted :)

What are your favorite ways of getting paid? The benfir of PayPal is that it's kinda like a bank account too.

Where I come from (Israel) our credit cards suck and really don't offer much (miles/benefits etc), so I'm thinking if I use PayPal, I could pull it to an American credit card for example, once I'll travel there and open a bank account (don' have to be a citizen, have done that before).

I'm a US based homestead farmer and I started doing remote work this year to help me build up my farm and earn a sustainable income that still gave me time and ability to stay close to my livestock and work on my property.   
My main limiting factors is that I really only have like 8 months of work history due to being the caregiving parent previously, and that I can't really take phone calls all day due to a noisy, busy household and animals so I have to decline or not apply for anything like phone based customer service. 

I did chat based customer support and that was great for me, but unfortunately the client wanted phones as well from my company and they couldn't split them up. I muddled through for about a week apologizing for roosters and dogs because ""the company is allowing us to work from home currently due to Covid"" but as I knew that wouldn't fly forever I leapt at the chance to move to a data entry job, but that unfortunately didn't last.   
Turns out I loved data entry out of any job I'd ever had. I loved being given a batch of raw data and working through it entirely on my own.   
After getting my feet wet, I realize that's what I would like to focus on- something I can work independently with efficiently in a data organizing sector ideally. Not against transcribing something into code but I tend to get really frustrated with programming based coding when the code doesn't work properly so I don't think that would fit. Bookeeping or chat/email based work can work for me too, but everyone wants those jobs and everyone applies for them."
hfd43h,,Homeless and looking to 'nomad',"Hey, I'm homeless right now. Barely anything in my bank account. I'm looking to catch a flight and make a living online once this covid stuff eases up.  


I'm looking for CHEAP places. I don't even want to be a 'nomad' per se, but just location-independent. Looking at Thailand. But the visa lasts about 3 months then I've got to find somewhere else right? What is the  lowest reasonable amount I can expect to live on and get by as a digital nomad. My only requirements are: private self contained flat/ apartment. Internet. (obviously electricity + water). I eant to go dirt cheap.

Not many super busy workaholic nomads since they're hiding in their hotel rooms.

But now that you often have decent WiFi in the rooms and more people have unlimited mobile data plans, why spend time at the WiFi lounges?

And with the social distancing, who wants to be around strangers in a lounge ever again? Even less try to talk with anyone or have them approach you.

hgwr9k,,Tips for three months in the western USA during COVID?,"My girlfriend and I are finally taking the leap and going to try our hands at being digital nomads. I'm a software engineer who has worked remotely and traveled solo for a long time and she's an event planner who's figuring out the next steps of her career in a COVID-19 world. We're both Americans in our late 20's/early 30's and currently live in the San Francisco Bay Area. We've both been talking about doing this for over a year, and now that she's been furloughed and we can't afford our absurdly high rent anymore we have the perfect excuse.

Our plan is to spend at least three months in the western US, spending each month in a different place. We'd like to stay in the west mostly because we're traveling by car and would like to know that we can get back to California in a day or two if necessary. Our vague idea is to start in the PNW and work our way in a clockwise loop through the Rockies, Texas and the southwest. (Not all of that would be in three months, of course.)

Do you all have any tips, especially where to live? We booked our first month, August, in a Portland Airbnb. Portland is ""safe"" in that it's very familiar to us and we know that we love it, but there are so many fascinating (and cheap!) options in Idaho, Utah, etc. Our main concerns as we find places are:

* If it's in a city, what will life be like with COVID-19 lockdowns, and does it make sense anymore to pick a place that's ""interesting"" vs. saving money and going to a small town vs. saving even more money and going to the boonies? (For reference, $2k/month rent is our hard upper limit; we're trying to keep it at $1.5k/month or less.)
* What opportunities, if any, are there for safe and responsible socialization in a new place during a pandemic?
* If it's in a resort town (we're finding so many out-of-season options in ski towns), will it feel like a ghost town?
* Is there some source for short-term lodging other than Airbnb and VRBO that we should know about? Craigslist has great deals but seems way too unreliable for short-term.

We've gone over all the ""logical"" scenarios in our head (for example, ""our own city is in lockdown so if we go to a place that's also in lockdown, we can expect that our lives will be similar to how we're living now."") I think what we're looking for is some special insights that we wouldn't be able to get until we hit the road.

Thanks!"

hho2b2,cm81n,Dual citizenship and working from country B,"Because there are relatively few posts around dual citizenship holders on here, I wanted to confirm my understanding of where I stand.

So - due to the likelihood of having to WFH from home for the foreseeable future, I was toying with the idea of temporarily moving to country B that I hold citizenship for, and working for my company as if I was still resident in country A (Obviously with their knowledge if I do go ahead).

Now - am I right in thinking that as long as I do not become a tax resident of country B, then working in country B is relatively straightforward? Owing to fact I am already a citizen of that country and therefore allowed to work there. Plus for all intents and purposes, I would be doing all my affairs in country A, including income etc. 

Are there any caveats I should be aware of beyond not becoming a tax resident? Naturally, if I did decide to go ahead, I'd probably seek more solid advice, although I haven't the faintest who I would approach - for now, this is only a vague idea/plan, nothing concrete.

- Need greenery & peaceful nature. 

- I don't party but I don't want to be socially isolated. I guess I'd rely on apps, language exchange, coworking to meet people? Not sure. I kinda feel anxious about this.

- I only consume water and beef (30kg/mo) so meat taste is important

- Aiming to spend $500/mo excluding transportation. If I discover an amazing source of meaning or fun, I'd increase my budget.

Seems like there are many good Airbnb entire place stays for $250 in those cities. Not sure if that's going to skyrocket once COVID restrictions are lifted. I asked locals and checked numbeo and seems like $500/mo is realistic.

I feel like I want to start with Buenos Aires but flight costs $1k and its pretty damn far. What if I dislike something and want to leave in a week? It'd be a waste. I thought of moving to Córdoba or Mendoza because better nature but I don't speak Spanish so I might get isolated there.

I'll go first. 

My mistake: I arrived overseas planning to use ATMs to withdraw cash for living expenses. I've been in this country before (cash society) and was able to make ATM withdrawals before, so I didn't think anything about it. But between the first time and the second time, I switched banks...only to find out that my new bank couldn't service ATMs in the country. I arrived with literally no way to pay for anything. Thankfully I found an ex-pat who was willing to let me transfer money to his bank and then he withdrew it for me.

How to prevent it: Get multiple banks and bank cards. I now have 4 banks that utilize different ATM networks so that, if one doesn't work, chances are very good that another one will work. It's a tad bit annoying to manage, but *way* better than being somewhere with no way to withdrawal cash.

hj3m6l,5260g0s7,Regarding offshore company formation,"Recently, I asked on this thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/hckr10/comment/fvxdmmw?context=3) about suggestions for countries to relocate to and fit excellent input. Thanks for that!

Now i would like to decide where to form my company (which could be an offshore company, I.e. not necessarily where I decide to live). Since I dont plan to live in Sweden (apart from few weeks of visit now and then) and my initial customer is a US/Canadian company,  it doesn't make sense to open the company here and pay crazy taxes. The corporate taxes are not actually that high here, but I have to pay myself a salary, and income taxes are quite high. On top of that, I have to account additional 30% more for social security that I have to pay for my employee, which is myself🤣. 

I googled a bit and Hong Kong, Dubai, Malta, Cyprus and Estonia were some of the countries that kept showing up. The rules of the different countries are confusing. For example, in HK, it seems that you need to justify that your business have some ties with the country (e.g. HK customers), while in Dubai, quite the opposite, where you are not allowed to do business within the country.

Anyways, I will keep on digging but in the meantime, I wanted to ask if anyone here is using an offshore company, and if so, any recommendations? I am not necessarily looking for 0 taxes, but would be great if I don't have to pay more than 10%.

Thank you!"

I was a digital nomad for 5 years....spent half the time in the U.S. (home) and half the time abroad. Loved every second of it. Whenever I was back home, I would be taking care of business (seeing friends/family, doing meetings) and planning my next trip.

Most of my romantic encounters were abroad too. Makes sense, as you'd be most likely to meet similar minded people while doing what you love.

Up until recently, I had a foreign nomad girlfriend and things were going great. When the pandemic hit, we both decided to go back to our respective countries because of Visa issues. Ended up having a discussion on where we would settle after having kids, and we both couldn't come to an agreement. Since I'm a ""half"" nomad with family roots & my business here, its hard for me to think that I would never live in the U.S. again (and she really doesn't want to live in the U.S.), so after a couples months of discussion, we called it quits.

Now, with the pandemic still in full force, I don't know when I would be able to leave the country again to travel and meet other like-minded people. I'm back ""home"" where everything is OK. I don't fully fit in with the ""normal"" crowd and it feels impossible to meet new people right now given everything. I also don't fully fit with the no-homebase-digital-nomad crowd.

I'm wondering if I created an identity around being ""the nomad guy"". If I was ever bored, I could just hop on a plane and be in a new and exciting place and meeting interesting people. For the last 5 years, even if stuff was boring while I was back home, I always had an exciting adventure to look forward to.

On top of that, I guess I realized that I want to settle around ""home"" again when I have kids (I'm 31 now, so in a few years)...but that means I'm going to have to give up the ""digital nomad"" life and live more full-time in the U.S. starting now.

I don't know what I'm feeling right now, but I guess I'm looking at the future and I'm not as excited about it as I was the last few years. It might be the same way for many on this subreddit. I think I was using digital nomad life to inject automatic excitement into my life, instead of building that excitement & community myself in my hometown. And now that we're grounded and Nomad life is on pause for an indefinite period of time, I'm feeling it."

hl1myn,4x14j7n9,"Hi all, this is my first blog post about what if Airbnb is not as it look with the photos. How can you get refund from it. Let me know what you think about my writing style :)","Hi nomads, I just wrote a post about how to get a refund from Airbnb when the actual house is different from the photo. Probably not the most relevant topic during the virus, but I get too much time on my hand...

The reason why I decided to write about this topic is because this happened to me quite a few times and I thought my perspective could help some people out there. Besides, I am my only reader so I can’t really give it a fair criticism.

So, here we go:

Everything mention below is better to be done within 24 hours after check-in. It is possible to get a refund after a 24 hour window, but things get more complicated after that.

&#x200B;

**Evaluate the property**

Sometimes, when you get too tired, you put on a negative filter on everything, especially the place you're gonna stay for next period.  

If that does not change your mind, be sure to have enough evidence.

Because, if you decide to complain to Airbnb, then there is no turning back. The host could be confrontational with you afterward.

&#x200B;

**Establish The Type Of Problems You Dealing With**

Identify the problems and assess if these are fixable or not. 

For example, if the Airbnb has no house heating, then this problem seems to be fixable. The host can simply provide you with a portable heater. That is it, problem fixed.

&#x200B;

**Document All The Faults**

Take a photo or video of all the problems on the property.

Also, check the Airbnb listing to see if the host mentions any of those things there. In other words, check if REALLY the Airbnb not as advertised.

If the host did not say anything in the listing, then you have solid grounds for the complaint. 

&#x200B;

**Contacting The Host**

Keep in mind that, at this point, you should have already established if the problems are fixable or not.

* Fixable: Be as friendly as possible and kindly ask him to fix the problem. Show him the photos you took if necessary and point to the fact that his Airbnb listing did not mention any of those problems.
* Unfixable: This situation is a bit more complicated so I separated what to do into steps.

1. Again, start the conversation being nice, but tell the host the problem is not acceptable
2. Tell him that you do not want to stay in the property anymore, because of such problems. 
3. Ask the host to pay you back the full amount

**Getting Written Records**

If you were talking until now with the host by voice or face-to-face and he refused to solve the problem, even though you showed him the Airbnb is not as advertised, then what I would do next is to send him a message on the Airbnb platform.

&#x200B;

**Contacting Airbnb Customer service**

Contact the Airbnb customer service using the Airbnb platform through their website or app.

Explain the problem to them and show photo evidence.

Also, point out that the problem was never made explicit in the Airbnb listing when you were booking.

But… what if Airbnb denies your refund, well, in that case, you have following three option:

1. Leave the property and lose the money
2. Call your credit card company and initiate a dispute
3. Accept the loss and stay in the property (this might include some minutes of crying in the shower on a fetal position as a side effect)

Beware, none of the outcome is good…

hlhjjb,13g7aw,Seeking feedback on an idea to build a digital nomad oriented farm/food forest in Ecuador,"I’m looking for feedback to gauge how feasible my idea is. I am considering buying a few acres of land in rural Ecuador and building small cabins and one large shared office space. I want to combine it with a food forest, garden, tilapia pond, and perhaps a few chickens and include access for guests to take whatever they need from the farm. Because Ecuador is such a low cost location, I believe I can keep rents in the $150 per person per month range. It would be a place for nomads to focus on work and healthy lifestyle while keeping expenses super low. 

Downsides that I see are that providing adequate internet speeds will be my greatest expense, and that Ecuador doesn’t allow you to do visa runs every 90 days like many Asian countries. Just a 90 day visa that can extend up to 180 days. Also, while Ecuador is low cost for many things, computers, phones, cameras, etc... are very expensive. Of course it probably will be boring for people that don’t enjoy small towns and rural life, but good for those that want a very peaceful location. 

The specific area I’m considering is about 1 hour from the Quito airport. It has a mild climate at about 1900 meters elevation. I’d like to stay within bicycle or long walk distance (between 2km and 5km) of a small town so it won’t be too isolated. 

I plan on buying the land and starting the farm/food forest either way, but I want to know if there is sufficient demand for such a location to justify making the investment required to meet most digital nomads needs. I would love to hear any thoughts or suggestions."

I spend the weekend looking into options to stay in Asia somehow but I don't think it will be possible, or only by a very short margin if new regulations arrive by the first of August.

I think I'll have to face the truth and prepare for traveling back to Europe (I'm a German citizen) and look into a good spot to stay for the time being.

Does anyone have any insight about possible options to stay in Asia when coming from Japan? Would love to hear :)

What's something you've learned to do that is uncommon or unlikely for a newbie to think of by themself?

I'll go first. Get an extra driver's license before you go. That way if your wallet is stolen, or you lose it, or someone takes it back in an effort to get a bribe out of you, you have another option.

Similar tip for US citizens, get a passport card as well as a passport book. It's super cheap and while it can only be used for immigration at US land borders, it is another federal form of ID. If your passport were ever lost/stolen, you'll still have a federal form of ID you can use. Or, in my case, you can send it off as a form of ID to get a social security card without needing to send off your driver's license or passport, which you probably need to have on hand. As a bonus, it doesn't list your address on your passport card, making it a more private form of ID than a driver's license."

hmr3ok,o6nsw,I made an app to help digital nomads compare cities to decide on their next destination.,"Howzit digital nomads 👋🇿🇦 I'm Ollie and I'm the maker of [Nomad Travel Tools](https://nomadtraveltools.com/). 😅

I travel regularly as a digital nomad. Before I decide to go anywhere, I need to research a few things such as:

💰 - Can I afford it?

⚡ - Is the internet fast enough?

🌐 - Do my work hours overlap the 2 different timezones?

💬 - What are other people saying about my potential destination?

So I created a web app that answers these questions and compares 📊 the answers to your home city (or any other city) to help you understand them better because not everyone thinks in dollars 🤑.

I think that community input before deciding on a destination is very important as data doesn't always cover the intricacies and nuances specific to a place. So my users have the option to post ✍️, chat 💬, and upvote 🗳️ relevant things contributed by the community.

It's free to create a profile on Nomad Travel Tools and you can start exploring 🗺️ and sharing too!

I hope it helps your future travels! 🔥🗺️

hmrkfx,l440a,After Belgrade.....,"I lived in Belgrade for seven months, and will skip over why I'm considering returning to the Balkans after a Western EU break <cough> cost of living <cough>.  That said, I have a pretty fair understanding of Belgrade and its pockets and culture and residency process.  Hence, looking for info on Sofia from a baseline I can understand.  I've heard bureaucracy is tougher in Bulgaria (lost papers, horrible information in applying for residency, etc.).  I received many apologies from Serbs about what I must be going through to get residency there, but frankly, I found people even in the administrative buildings to be rather helpful (Savska 35 a little less so, but generally helpful all the same).  What might I expect in Sofia?

More than that, what I really want to know about is the ""vibe.""  I couldn't stand Belgrade after a while. All the indoor smoking was a deterrent enough from a social scene, but the absolute embrace of alcohol over intelligence, the outright nationalism everywhere, the generally ""behind the times"" attitudes could feel stifling at times.  Is there a greater space for intelligence, entrepreneurs, individualists, weirdos, etc. in Sofia?   Or are the Balkans just generally people who seek homogeneity and a return to communism?

I'm also considering the Baltics, namely Estonia.  I have heard the people can be a lot colder there, but I enjoy quiet and keep busy enough on my own with work and projects, so if the scene isn't so bad for ""outsiders, it might be worth considering as well.  Basically, due to a lot of unforeseen troubles, I think finances are going to force me back east for a bit (was planning on settling in Portugal, but ... maybe later).   

I appreciate all thoughtful contributions to this thread.  

And I should probably say that I tend to stick to capitals because of the prevalence of English, foreigners, and more progressive mentalities, but I am not really a true city-lover, and any good communities that could work are great.  I've heard Plovdiv could be very good in Bulgaria, as well.  

And lastly, I add this as an after-thought, but maybe worth mentioning, I'd like to be able to date without too much trouble.  I don't have trouble with this in the West, so hopefully somewhere with open enough attitudes towards sex and relationships, and enough English this wouldn't be an issue.   
 Baltics don't sound good...  Save the odd comments on this, I just don't want to move somewhere to be confined to abstinence based on culture.  

If there's somewhere in Western Europe I haven't thought of for a reasonable cost of living (my own place for under 500), I'm all ears.  Residency is also a consideration, though, as I'm getting tired of the moving around at this point.  Putting in this sub, though, because of the wide range of experiences in living different places.  Thanks!"

hn97w2,4x14j7n9,A how-to on choosing between Airbnb and hotel. My two cents on long-term travel accommodation options.,"Hi all, 

So, a quick introduction about myself. I’ve been a digital nomad for all of my adult life. My current country count is around 80. My ultimate goal is to visit every country in the world.

One of the biggest problems I have in my journey is accommodation. 

I enjoy staying in a place for around a month or two, so usually, I tend to choose Airbnb or similar long-term rental. Usually, other popular options like couch surfing or hostels are not reliable or not suitable for the long term. 

So I come up with a system (more like a comparison) on how to choose the remaining option:

1. Long-term rental holiday house (Airbnb)
2. Hotel

**If the cost of your destination is low**

On the one hand, hotels are used by both locals and foreigners. 

On the other hand, Airbnbs are mostly used by foreigners. 

Due to this asymmetry of the customers’ demographics only hotels are compelled to set their prices in accordance with the rest of the prices paid by locals. 

If the city has a low cost of living then it is likely hotel prices will below also.

Keep in mind that this rule is not absolute. But it is generally true when we are comparing a hotel and an Airbnb of the same “quality” in cities with a cheap cost of living.

Southeast Asia is a good example. In this part of the world, which has a very low cost of living, it is very common to find hotels in the city center that are cheaper than Airbnbs in the same area.

**If the city you are visiting is small**

The smaller the city is, the less likely there will be a good (if any) option in terms of Airbnb.

Generally, there isn't enough demand for Airbnbs in small cities, since this type of accommodation is more targeted to foreigners.

Hotels are a more traditional form of accommodation. Therefore these can be found almost anywhere.

So, as a rule of thumb, if you are going to a small city it is better to look for a hotel.

**If you want to socialize on your trip**

With hostels, you will be staying in a place that provides a chill vibe where people are generally open to meet other travelers. 

With Couchsurfing, you can socialize with the host which most likely is a local himself and a person that is eager to meet travelers.

You might ask yourself “What is the difference between socializing with a Couchsurfing host and an Airbnb host?  Both are likely to be locals”. 

The answer has to do with the hosts' attitude.

Generally, there is a difference in terms of the attitude of Airbnb hosts and Couchsurfing hosts concerning the relation of themselves with their guests. 

Most Airbnb hosts see what they are doing as a business, thus they are less likely to be interested in socializing with the guests. But, of course, there are exceptions here.

On the other hand, Couchsurfing is a free and voluntary service. Consequently, Couchsurfing usually attracts hosts that are directly interested in meeting and talking with their guests.

**If you don’t have much time in the destination**

If you have little time in a place, it makes sense to stay in a hotel or hostel, rather than on an Airbnb.

Because, well, you can’t really treat Airbnb as a hotel room. After all, you are staying in someone else's property…

TL;DR: I make a comparison that in different scenarios or purpose that what accommodation you should choose for your next trip. Generally, I think Airbnb is the winner.

Let me know what you think!"

I am sitting here in Stockholm itching to go to Mexico. I got a positive corona antibody test recently, so I feel pretty good about going.

My biggest concern at the moment is if I can get there. Is there a preferred route at this time? Thinking of leaving after August btw. Most of the flights have a stop in the US. I would love to stay there for a week at a friends place, but I'm also thinking it might be stupid if anything happens and I can't make it to Mexico.

I'm guessing my safest bet is to pay a lot more for a direct flight from Europe. But that would be twice as expensive, roughly.

Am I over-thinking this? Is it pretty safe to assume that if I can book a flight I will make it to my final destination? Even through the US? (Disregarding all the normal non-corona related things that can happen.)

ho09jz,,Trusted Housesitters is a scam,"This may not come as a surprise to some people on here but for those who are thinking about signing up to Trusted Housesitters or are perhaps feeling a bit discouraged by being ignored by homeowners you should know that Trusted Housesitters populates their own site with fake ads.  


Often you'll find a popular housesit which seems far too good to be true so you run a quick reverse image search which will reveal that the images have been stolen from other websites. If you then check the housesit after the supposed ""sit"" you'll see no reviews by either a sitter or owner.   


During the Covid pandemic when most owners took their listings down it seemed that every fifth sit was a fake ad and because the owners have to pay a fee to list their home I am convinced that the site itself is creating these ads. Especially when I found a fake sit which was referred to as ""admin test"" and used the same language and description as other fake sits.  


The whole thing is very scummy not only do sitters waste their time applying for these fake sits but some people might be enticed to sign up to the site based on these far too good to be true sits. Even worse is when the site steals pictures from other websites such as hotels, air bnbs, animals pictures from shelters they even take pictures of children to help sell the ad as a real family hoping for someone to care for their home and pets...

ho0x6t,bahve,Headset recommendation,"Hello friends and nomads,

I'm looking to slowly gear up for a trial run and I need a new headset. I've used and loved the HyperX cloud II for many, many years and I feel it's time to retire it. The new headset must fit into my future plans of course. So I come to you, to learn from your experience in this department.

**Need:** Comfortable, light-weight, wired and good mic.

**No need for:** Noise blocking or anything like that, no 7.1 BS or similar stuff.

**Good to have:** Take up less space, maybe there are soon good fold-able, but also durable headsets out there

Ideally I'll be using it both on the road and in a more settled environment. However, I'm more than open to getting a less-than-ideal for comfort, but optimized for on-the-road-headset.

Someone suggested me PC37X, but upon reading the specs, it appears to be even heavier than my current HyperX cloud II, which doesn't bode well for getting an improvement.

**A note about the weight of the headsets and probably yours.** I note there's a lot of focus on improve working conditions, especially using tools to elevate monitor height to better alignment, which is great. But I haven't seen any talk of headsets throughout my lurkings on this sub.

As an IT nerd like most of you (I assume), our bodies are bound to take a hit when working long hours in front of the screens. I've worked really hard over a few years to improve my posture and for me, the most stubborn aspect is ""nerd neck"" or forward head posture. One of the issues with solving this bit is the relatively heavy stuff we add on top of our already heavy nuggets, further exaggerating our unhealthy posture.

**tl;dr: What headset would you recommend? And a note about ergonomics of headsets**

hp0edh,hpz6e,Any Mexpats willing to give advice on choosing a place in Mexico to live?,"I'm quite set on moving to Mexico later this year. My original plan was to move to CDMX but the coronavirus is making me reconsider whether that's a good place to be, at least until the pandemic has at least stabilized more globally. I know the best advice is to just go places and see where you like but I think that would be a grossly irresponsible thing to do during the pandemic so instead I'm just trying to do extensive research and pick a place. I'm wondering what the insights are of expats that have lived in Mexico given my criteria. Lost post because I'm writing this out just as much for myself as I am for advice, but **TLDR: Just read the bold parts**

**Here's what I'm looking for, in order of most to least important:**


1. **Good Internet -** I will be working *two* remote jobs and will need to have reliable and fast internet. Non negotiable.

2. **Reducing Costs -** Right now I pay $1350/m on living expenses (*extremely* good for what I’m getting in NYC and honestly hard to be walking away from such a fantastic deal) which includes internet, electricity, gas, and water. I don’t cook and spend about $10-$20 daily per meal here (usually I only have two meals per day) and on a normal, pre covid week I’d also spend a decent amount per week going out for drinks. I’d like to keep living a similar lifestyle, but reduce costs in those main three areas while keeping a similar level of comfort. The main financial reason for my move is to cut down on my mountain of student loan debt. The **general price range I’d like is $700 - $1100/m for my home expenses.** Obviously the less I pay within that range the better.

3. **Eating Good -** I love food. I would like to die a delicious death. As previously mentioned I don’t cook (I can, I just don’t), so I will need a decent variety of places to eat around me. Since I’ll be eating out constantly, I’d prefer to have more variety of food for a good price closer to me than I would have fancier places that will be more expensive or less variety.

4. **Friends -** This will be challenging in the current pandemic, but I will be moving here as a single male in my late 20’s/ early 30’s. That means unlike expat couples I will be extremely lonely if I don’t find some kind of community. Therefore I need a place with a good english speaking population. A big part of the reason I’m moving is to learn the spanish language, but initially my spanish will not be strong enough to make a solid bond that doesn’t speak english. As time progresses though, I will want to be in a friendly location where I can meet spanish speakers around my age.

5. **Beauty -**  This is one of the biggest reasons I’m moving to a city in Mexico instead of just going to some bumblefuck place in the US. Sure I can have the same relative costs in a smaller place in the US, but then it’d be so boring to be there. I know that not every street in Mexico will be the prettiest, but anything with some level of charm will make me happy.

6. **Space -** This is a requirement initially because of covid, but also became more important due to the fact I may no longer be able to work in WeWork (I previously had unlimited global access and there also wasn’t a pandemic lol). I’m going to be spending a lot of time in my own home, so I’m going to need to feel uber comfortable within my own home. As the pandemic situation improves this will become less of an issue.

7. **Indulging Hobbies -** Some of my hobbies are easily done at home. This would include music production, watching movies, and playing video games. Other hobbies require more externally. These include dancing, boxing, biking, learning an instrument, and a new addition to the list, hiking. For some of these I will have to take an L. Boxing at any time during the pandemic is likely a wash. Getting a piano teacher also seems risky. But having a bikeable place where I can occasionally also go out for a hike sounds great in these times.

8. **Ease of getting around -** If it’s difficult for me to get around, I’m not going to enjoy where I’m at. Full stop. I don’t see myself getting a car at any point and this is a potential sneaky large expense. 

9. **Coronavirus response -** I've already had the terrible fortune to be in a city while 30k people died and many more where hospitalized. I'd rather not go through that again. Cities/States that have been handling things better have a slight advantage to me"
hp1dfv,61jqurtf,Is carrying around nice camera equipment for travel videos too annoying?,"So I do videography for work, and I've been thinking it would be fun to start doing some travel vlogging on some of my trips. 

The camera I use for my client projects is a sony a6500. I have a 10-18mm lens, a g master zoom lens, and some more telephoto lens, I forget the mm on those ones Haha. I also just got a sony rx100v that I found on sale to test out and see how i like it.

Anyways, what is people's experience with bringing cameras like that while travelling? My thought is that while I would definitely notice the difference of a nice camera and lens, and I would really enjoy making something of a higher production value, I don't want to be constantly worrying about my gear and having to lug it around everywhere. And I would be a bit worried about leaving my expensive equipment anywhere if I decided to go somewhere without it. 

Is it annoying to do travel vlogging with a bigger camera like the a6500 (I know it's not actually a big camera, it's a mirrorless haha), compared to something like a compact point and shoot like the rx100v?"

hpfqb7,143qs2,"Pros & Cons of Bocas del Toro, Panama as digital nomad (travel film included)","Hey guys, I visited this archipelago many years ago, with the Nomad Cruise crew,  and found out amazing is to work & live there, so I wanted to go back and make a film, like a love letter, to this amazing place.

[You can watch the video here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMJrXKCSWzQ)

And here is my overview of the place, if you are interested on visiting it, too.

**Pros**

* Nature. The big plus of this area is surrounding of water and forest. I just love the idea of island hopping to every location, and just having the water close to you anytime you want.
* Cost of living. Prices are relatively low for a small town and the use of USD as their currency makes it easy to calculate your monthly costs.Prices are relatively low for a small town and the use of USD as their currency makes it easy to calculate your monthly costs.
* Food. Even tho the Panamanian gastronomy ain't the best, there's a lot of international cuisines in here, even vegan options.
* Fun. There's just so much cool things to do, especially water related: diving, kayak, boat, paddleboarding, snorkeling, swimming, etc.
* Safety. As the tourism is big part of their economy, they take care of foreigners so you can feel calm most of the time.

**Cons**

* Wifi speed. There's just a few places, like Selina, where you can find great wifi but besides that, it's hard to really fast speed.
* Too much party. Now this depends on your style, but Bocas Town is almost live dancing every night. Which is cool for a day, but later it becomes too noisy. At least in the islands around is quieter
* Low access. As it's an archipelago, you won't find many options of technology or deliveries, so it's better to be over-prepared when you stay there.
* Humid. It's not news coming from the Caribbean coast, but the weather can get very hot, and not everyone likes that.

Here is the most important information needed to consider the option to live in Bocas del Toro, Panama.

* When to go - It's very humid most all year round, so anytime is good to go but you can visit in December if you want to skip cold winter in other places.
* Weather - Average temperatures vary very little. Considering humidity, temperatures feel hot all year with a fair chance of precipitation about half of the year. The warmest time of year is generally early to mid March where highs are regularly around 94.4°F (34.7°C) with temperatures rarely dropping below 73.7°F (23.2°C) at night.
* Currency - Even tho they have their own currency (Panamanian Balboa), you can use USD dollar as it's the same rate.
* Language - Spanish is the main language, but as tourism is important here, a lot of people still speak english.
* Data - There are big companies like Movistar or Claro with relatively cheap prices for data.
* Visa - Most country citizens are allowed to stay from 90-180 days without hassle.
* Safety - As the tourism is big part of their economy, they take care of foreigners so you can feel calm most of the time.

Bocas del Toro is an archipelago of a bunch of islands (9 to be exact). The 3 main islands which visitors frequent are: Isla Colon, Isla Solarte and Isla Bastimentos.

However, when people are saying they’re going to Bocas, they typically mean they’re headed to Bocas Town. That's the main island where you arrive from, and where's most of the human activity is happening.

It's better to book a place in Bocas Town, and then just move around each day. For longer trips, just book ahead a place in any island (like Red Frog) for a couple of days and come back to Bocas Town.

There are two Selina's. One in Bocas Town that's very noisy and more a backpacker style, which I don't recommend to stay if you want peace of mind. It's great only for the coworking space.

But the one in Red Frog it's a beautiful place, where I recommend to stay for a weekend or so.

If you want to book an apartment, it's better to be there to meet people in person and get a better deal. You can always check Airbnb to book in advance, but just remember that is a small town so there's won't be many options available.

All around Bocas Town there are taxis in yellow pickup trucks. It's  only 1 USD to move from one corner to other of the island. Really cheap.

But when moving around the islands, you just need to visit any dock and get a 1-5 USD water taxi boat.

I see there are quite a few DN in Thailand right now. What is your visa situation? Are you planning to leave before the end of the month? Where will you go? 

I work remotely and my husband and I have been in Bangkok since February. I read that visa amnesty is likely to end without being extended (I was hoping they’d give us another month since borders all around us are still closed!) We have no idea where to go (“home” to the US isn’t really an option) and it’s so stressful trying to figure it out as conditions seems to change, daily. I’d love to stay put.

hpsv03,486ye6x,ISO: Powered USB hub,"TL;DR: Looking for recommendations for a powered USB hub, preferably with a wall wart

Context: My laptop has three USB ports. Full up work-mode I need six. In addition, I have crew that want to charge personal electronics. I can't count on AC power and 12VDC access is often limited. I run my laptop of 12VDC (mission critical) either directly off house batteries or from the (usually one) 12VDC outlet at the nav station (which is my office). I have two Aukey CB-H4 but they don't work well for charging and have both failed after a year. 

I'm looking for a powered up that can be used as a charging station (60W would be lovely) not connected to a computer and as a hub for my devices connected to my laptop. 

The desire for a wall wart is that most feed 12VDC into the hub, so I can lop off the converter (the 'wart') and run directly off house batteries. 

I've flexed Google and Amazon and CNET. Still looking. Any ideas?"
hq309w,1ezej6eb,Is it possible to be a digital nomad if your business sells physical items?,"Hello,

I've been thinking about wanting to be a digital nomad (but nomading within the US first) and while my question kind of contradicts the term **digital** nomad, I am wondering if this is possible? Right now I am an illustrator and sell digital prints but also want to sell small items like stickers, pins, and zines, and maybe small physical prints. I don't have a studio or any dedicated art space and I don't have plans to have such a thing. I don't think I'll be able to make enough of a living selling just digital prints. I want to expand and sell physical items but I also want the freedom to move around and travel while running my business.

hqm682,4d0agt6z,"Ex-nomad went back to corporate life, now hating it and wanting out","Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I used to be a DN until a few months back. I didn't move around as much as some DNs do, but I was def living the DN life. When I started out a few years ago, I got lucky enough  to find something that works very fast. I guess I was also at the right time at the right place. I managed to make about 150k (profit, no black hat methods in case you're wondering) in less than three years, but then it slowly stopped working, algorithm changed and competition grew. In the last 2+ years, I haven't been able to make more than a few hundred $ every month. Maybe I should have tried something new but I didn't, so I started living off my savings.

Three months ago, I was contacted by a company and they ended up offering me a full-time job. I hated the idea of having to go back to the office, but I was told that I might be able to work fully remote at some point, and also the money was good. I still had about 100k in savings, but I was worried about my future, so I accepted the job.

Fast forward to now. I've been working in the company for over a month. And while I don't completely hate it, I also don't like it and I feel unhappy. I feel trapped, unsatisfied and I feel like I'm wasting precious life time that I'll never get back. It's not about traveling for me- I don't mind settling in the city where I am for a while. I just feel like I have no life anymore and I'm selling a big part of my life. I'm in the office from 8:30am to 6pm every day. When I asked if I could do home office a few days a week I was told no, that the CEO wants us in the office at all times (even though I haven't even met or seen him ever). I get home from work every night feeling exhausted. I hate Monday to Wednesday especially. I've become one of those people who just live for the (short) weekends.

Now let's get to my question- What would you do in my shoes? 

Since I only started about 6 weeks ago, I'm thinking to give it another two months or so to see if I adapt and magically start liking it. But what if I don't? Financially, I could just quit the job and live off my savings again. But I know I won't be able to forever, nor do I want to. It's not that I don't like working- I would love to be passionate about a project again, work my ass off and invest my time in something that's mine. I just don't know what's the right thing to do. Or if I should stop whining and just accept that I'm a corporate slave now, like so many other people. By the way, I do marketing, not coding, in case that's important.

&#x200B;

What would you do in my shoes?"
hr1bdt,iqehl,Risks of traveling now vs. in 3 months,"Hello my cool fellow DNs! I have been stuck in eastern europe for some months now (not that I’m complaining). My next destination is Mexico. I am weighing the pros and cons of traveling now versus in three months when my visa-free stay here expires.

Obviously traveling in the current situation is not ideal but in terms of risks involved, as more and more borders open up and the masses will start traveling, I only see the situation getting worse until some sort of affordable vaccine or medication is mass produced and I don’t think we’ll see that any time soon. 

So I’m here for a sanity check: is there any reason why I shouldn’t pack my bags and leave for Mexico now as opposed to three months from now? Thank you.

EDIT: 

Thank you folks for sharing your thoughts and wisdom. After considering the risks involved, I have decided to stay here till I am forced to leave. 

I think even a ""visa run"" here will potentially carry with it less risk than traveling for 24+ hours through 4 international airports. Thanks again and wishing you and your family a covid-free year."

As someone who loves to travel and planning to retire in a few years (mid to late 30s), what do you usually say if a border official asks what you are doing? This question has been bugging me for some time. Would you take time to explain that you retired early or work online? Or would you rather just be vague unless queried further?

As I do more research, I'm seeing that I have less than ideal qualifications for a sustainable DN lifestyle, but I think I could make it work for awhile. Currently working in an operations role at a financial services company (stereotypical lame 9-5). Unfortunately, my job cannot be done 100% remote so I'll have to find something new.  
   
I handle the day to day ops stuff for a few high profile clients. We use in-house software, and I've coordinated and participated in a lot of UAT, wrote up specs for new features, and attend stand ups. I have dabbled in some programming; I have fundamental java, python, and SQL knowledge but I'm far from an [employable] programmer.   
  
There's not a ton, but I have seen some job listings for remote Business Analysts, QA Analysts, and general ops roles I would potentially be qualified for.

hrocho,p263g,"Looking to work remotely from September-December, 2020. Puerto Escondido, Santa Teresa, or somewhere else?","I'm planning on working remotely since I'm currently in NYC and just want to be at a beach during the quarantine. For my job, I have \~5 video calls/day so I really need stable wifi, and need to be on a US timezone, but that's about it.

Since I want to live in a beach, I'm considering Puerto Escondido in Mexico or Santa Teresa in Costa Rica. Does anyone have any tips about any of those places?

The major downsides about Puerto Escondido are I hear the Wifi isn't super reliable and you can't walk on the beach after dark. (I'm a 20-something woman)

That said, I'm leaning towards Santa Teresa. The major downsides of Santa Teresa are that you have to leave after 3 months (I'm looking to stay 4) and since October is rainy season, Wifi is also unreliable.

Does anyone have any experience living in any of these places, or can you recommend somewhere else with a beach? I'm looking to escape city life and just be in nature for a bit. 

I know everything is complicated with COVID and who knows if I'll even be able to enter borders in Sept.

I feel so-so about the research done at the European job, but it would allow me to stay in Europe for another year and I would have to change nothing about my current life in Europe (I wouldn't even have to move). Whereas the job in America pays significantly more (even has 25 days vacation!) and the research is very interesting, but with the US being a political dumpster fire and with COVID out of control in America, severe restrictions on US passports, and 2020 generally being an insane roller coaster, I'm getting cold feet. The US job is the better career move, but the European job definitely the safer option.

I don't want to be a victim of crime and I have to assume I'll pick up COVID in travels, so I also would prefer to be in a developed country with decent medical care. However, my mindset right now is ""get to certain safety first, ask questions later"". And the risk of crime or medical mismanagement may be lower than the risk of running out of money. So I'm on the fence about islands/Mexico vs. whatever is open to Americans in Europe. I don't think I'd go to Asia.

I have tickets to go to the UK in September (I'm familiar with it and have distant family members there, though they won't help me much) but I'm thinking of changing them and leaving in early August. I've already gotten offers for travel insurance (I'm thinking GeoBlue) but haven't found a place or done anything else. I can either still go there or go somewhere else. And I can either stretch my dollar and hope I'll get another job soon or pick a cheaper country. Where would you go if you were me, and when? Do you think I'm doing myself in by wanting to leave without the resources, or is it smart?"

htypu0,5lzipizd,"US citizen tried to leave Thailand to Germany, was not allowed to check-in. Be careful if you're trying to do the same (still working on leaving, talked to german immigration after)3","This may be helpful for someone else, so I will post the details. Saw someone else that had a similar situation. I have to be in Germany for work (german employer) and we have some conferences coming up, so I must go if I can.

I have been in Thailand since February so I crossed the 3-month line, had my rental contract in hand.

**Check-in**\-

I went in to check in with Qatar, and they immediately said US citizens can't travel to Germany right now. I told them that yes you can if traveling from Thailand... they said no, I, unfortunately, couldn't find official information to back me up. Should've done more research first.

I asked them to please check with the German border police, thinking that they'd give them the go-ahead. They took my passport, scanned the pages, went to some backroom and said they would email them, and came back about 20 minutes later saying ""Germany said no"". I couldn't get them to give me a reason either.. it was quite strange. I don't think they were lying about talking to Germany, I don't see why they would do that, but the situation was weird. I was really polite and nobody was angry, so I don't think it was that sort of situation either. I don't know if it was confusion, or something else.

**After**\-

I went home thinking I am screwed for this big work thing, was going to give up, but I called the German immigration department on a whim last night. After going through a couple people eventually the head of german immigration police (or something similar) told me they are incorrect, I should have been let in. He asked me to email him my passport with all the pages, tell about the situation, and he would send a reply over to me that I can show the airline. Did that and it looks good. in his reply he said ""Since July 2, 2020, the state of Thailand has been on the list of states for unlimited entry options. If you can prove that you have been in Thailand for three months, you can enter Germany on the basis of your information.""

**Now**\-

Stayed in Thailand, went to the beach to chill out while I work on this. Phuket is incredibly dead right now, boring and refreshing in a way.

My next step is to get Qatar airlines on the phone and try to get a harder confirmation before I book that I should be let in. Will forward the email and situation to them. I may try a different airline... I think Lufthaunsa will probably be less confused about the situation. Still dunno, airline call centers at BKK airport are mainly closed on Sunday.

**Other**\-

They also said I needed to have a ticket to return back to the US specifically. I tried to tell them I'd get a ticket to Croatia since tourists are allowed there, and they said I still need to get one to the US after that.. even though I haven't lived in the US for about 14 months. I bought one from [onward.com](https://onward.com) (EDIT- onwardticket.com) but unfortunately I think it's kinda sketchy. They don't give you a flight #, just a PKN number. I know that the [onward.com](https://onward.com) (EDIT- onwardticket.com)  ticket didn't have an influence, because I didn't show them the ticket until late in the conversation, after they already sent the email. Right as the lady was writing on a piece of paper my flight info is when the other one came back with the refusal. She was just asking me about where my flight # is and all that, which it doesn't show one because Onward doesn't give you one. I don't recommend using it especially because in this situation you're gonna be asked a lot of questions.

&#x200B;

Anyways hope this was helpful. Good luck and wish me the same ☺

**Update June 20th-** I've been back and forth with immigration and swiss airlines about 6 times the past 2 days, and it doesn't sound like swiss will let me on the plane. IATA guidelines say that only **residents** of Thailand will be allowed in, and since I'm on tourist/amnest, I won't be allowed to board. I even forwarded them the German immigration email that said I am clear to get in, they said still I can't. I think I am giving up on going into Germany. It appears that you can get into France and Switzerland though, and just fly over if you need. Talked to Switzerland immigration and they said as of today I am let in the country.

**Update June 21st**\- I gave up. No matter what the german authorities were telling the thai authorities, they wouldn't listen and the airlines became so hard to get a hold of. Thailand extended visa amnesty so gonna get back at it in a month. Good luck everyone hope this was helpful

I am looking at options for health insurance. 

I am a remote worker that splits my time between Taiwan and Canada (no dependents). I am mainly concerned about getting catastrophic coverages, like cancer. I opted out of my company's benefits because it seemed a tad on the expensive side ($3.5K CAD, and a lot of expenses are only 80% covered by the provider). 

Looking for good recommendations for providers (cost/benefit). My search has turned up the following so far: 

SafetyWing (Now Health), Cigna, IMG, Allianz, and Bupa. 

Anyone have experience with any of these and can provide a solid yes/no recommendation?

My original plan was to go to Colombia and have that as my home base. Then came Covid and it crapping on every plan ever made lol. So on to plan b. After 4 months only leaving my apartment for the essentials and my lease expiring the end of this month. Question was where to go. First plan was Aruba, however at the last minute Aruba changed entry guidance for heavy hit states by the Coronavirus. Texas was included and as testing was at a premium I could not get results in 72 hours. Now to plan c. I booked trip to the DR however after reading expats boards and learning their hospitals we're almost full. Plan D. Barbados announces the DN welcome stamp and will let you test on arrival. So I pay a princely sum and I am off. 

Only people flying US to Barbados at present is Air Canada. Booked my ticket. Went to check in online and couldn't. Call customer support and the line said they arent taking calls. Wtf. Find another number and after an hour and a half talk to someone who says I should be fine just check in at airport. Get to airport and I am denied boarding the flight as I am not Canadian and have an overnight layover. 3 more hours on the phone and I am rebooked for travel 3 days later with authorization to stay over night. This time after a couple phone calls and 20 minutes I am allowed to check in. Flight to Canada was in eventful. Every one masked and you are given a baggie with mask, gloves, sanitizer water and wipes. No beverage or food service even in first class. 

Had a 15 hour layover in Toronto. Food closes at 10pm re opens at 6am. Flight was at 825am. Same baggie given on flight two. Arrived in Barbados and have two lines those with tests those without. I was second person tested on my flight. You are given 3 options. Test and wait in airport. Test is free. Test at airport and wait at approved hotel. Hotel is 300nt usd. 3rd is test and wait at hotel. Test 140usd hotel 300usd. I waited at the airport. Total wait time is about 7.5 hours so prepare yourself. I was negative allowed to collect my bags and given ride to front of airport where cabs are. Cab to my Airbnb was 50 usd. 

As you can see barbados isn't cheap. This is no Phuket or Costa Rica. This is my biggest knock so far. People are super nice. My Airbnb is about 375 a week. But it is huge can sleep 6 and it's only me. Cabs and food are expensive. Think Hawaii like prices or worse. Bus is reasonable but haven't taken it yet. I am 10 min walk to beach for me... I walk slow. Internet is good my speed at Airbnb is 40-80 Mbps. Any other questions let know. Plan on staying here until Colombia opens up hopefully in September."

I suffer from chronic pain and the last couple of summers, I've noticed just how much better I feel when the temperatures hit 20+ celcius (actually, probably 22+ celcius). It's day and night. I feel so much better.

Unfortunately we have very few days a year with 20+ degrees here in Denmark.

I am thus planning to relocate 180 days of the year or so to other countries where the sun shines more.

I imagine I will spend a month or maybe two in Asia, but I'm looking for somewhere specific in Europe, that has:

* A lot of sun hours with temperatures above 22+ celcius
* Cheapish, but doesn't need to be dirt cheap
* Good private health care
* Not a pensioner/family place only, lots of diverse stuff going on, real city
* Brits, Scandic communities is a plus
* Access to mountains and/or the sea is a plus

Some places I've considered seriously:

* Marbella, Spain
* Limassol, Cyprus
* St. Lucian, Malta
* Tenerife, Canary Islands

Places that might be good, but I know little about them:

* Athens, Greece
* Varna, Bulgaria
* ?, Portugal
* ?, Montenegro

I love Ubud because the general vibe it offers - relaxed atmosphere, vegan/organic restaurants everywhere, focus on health and nutrition (yoga barns, massage shops, spas, etc), not a big city and most important - low cost of living! 

  
I've only been in off-season to avoid the bigger crowds (don't think I would like it as much with 4x the amount of people) so it always feels perfect to me. 

  
I am vegan and live a very health conscience life. Places like Ubud allow me to easily continue this lifestyle and feel relaxed. I'm not one of those travelers who goes and tries every local junk food (I usually stick to my diet). 

  
I do enjoy visiting bigger cities but when it comes to living, I much prefer smaller cities like Ubud (where I can walk/bike everywhere and breath fresh air). 

  
With that being said, what city/town/place have you been to that has a similar vibe to Ubud?

I ask this because I understand that Transferwise gives you an IBAN, but bansk in some countries have issues with their IBAN or something.

The reason I want Revolut/Transferwise for business is because of the exchange rates, as my local banks have too high exchange rates from USD/EUR to my local currency, and I'd be losing money in the process.

\- Create a new personal brand 

\- Offer to shoot for free at first, and build up (for agencies, resorts, travel, etc.)

\- Becomes negotiations for free accommodations, and eventually paid 

\- Transition to consulting and selling an info product

Other income sources would be: 

\- Crypto leveraged trading/staking/etc. - 10-20% return 

\- p2p loans - 25% monthly return 

So basically: 

\- $2000 (could be more by May) a month certain through regular income. 

\-reduce > offset > come out ahead through offering travel photography/videography/sponsorships (later) at destinations

This will be a long-ish post but I'd appreciate any and all feedback! I am an engineer with a company in the shipping/logistics industry with an office staff of \~50 and 400 total employees, so my work does have a decent impact/value to the company even though I'm entry level. This is my first job out of college, and I have been with the company 4.5 years (I'm 26 years old). I make good money ($80k) and have full benefits. Most employees have been working remotely for the past 4 months due to COVID. I am not a programmer and more along the lines of mechanical engineering/project management, but our company heavily uses the cloud (Microsoft Sharepoint, Teams, etc.) for document storage, teleconferencing, etc. and I have largely been able to do my work (design review, vendor interaction, etc.) from home. My direct boss is 77 years old and relies on me for a lot, but so far he has also done decently well with remote work (although I'm sure he'd prefer to be in the office). Overall our company culture is decently laid back (flexible hours, not picky with sick time, etc.) and is more focused on getting work done, but there is an expectation that people will return to the office at some point.

However, during quarantine I met a friend that owns their own small business and is planning on living in a van around the country for the next year or two. Seeing their lifestyle and overall passion for life made me realize that I am missing out on exploring the world we live in and meeting some amazing people along the way. I go to the same office every day (well, before COVID), see the same people, and do the same things every weekend. It's not a bad life, especially with the pay and benefits, but I'm realizing that it is stagnant, and this is the prime time in life to explore. So, I have been thinking of ways that I can possibly keep my job while doing some traveling. I don't want to quit my job, partially due to student loans and partially because I don't know what I'd do instead. Assuming my direct boss approves, my proposal to the president of the company (a younger, fairly approachable guy) would be something like this, spoken as if I'm talking to the president:

1. I've been with your company for almost 5 years, and love the work we do, the people, and the company culture, and I'm looking forward to many more years of working here.
2. However, I've realized that outside of work all I have known is Midwest USA, and there's a whole world that I'm missing out on seeing. This is the prime time in my life to explore (no wife, kids, etc.) and I have a strong desire to expand my worldview. \[this may sound like millennial BS to the president, but I'm hoping to find a good way to be honest but sound serious\]
3. I've worked from home for 4 months during COVID and my boss and I feel that I am as effective as I was while working in the office.
4. I would ask that I be given the option to work remotely 3 months (not necessarily consecutive) out of the year), with the expectation that I would always be available for calls/meetings during standard office hours, that the quality of my work would not diminish, and that I would make myself available in the office (with enough notice) for major meetings/events. Benefits (401k, insurance, etc.) would not be affected.
5. I understand that your expectation is that employees eventually return full-time to the office, but as a benefit to you I would propose that I take a 25% decrease in base salary. \[I could also phrase this simply as I'm willing to take a decrease in salary in an amount that we can discuss would be mutually agreeable\].
6. I love working for this company, and this arrangement would allow my to greatly improve my overall life satisfaction while maintaining my commitment to you and the company. I'd appreciate you giving this some thought. Thanks.

I've done the math and I can comfortably afford a 25% pay cut with my current lifestlye. I am planning on buying a duplex and living in one side, which would save me $15000 a year in rent. In another 1.5 years I'll have my student loans paid off, saving me another $17000 per year. Basically, with those two savings I can maintain my current lifestyle on $39000 pre-tax salary while still putting the max match in my 401k. 

So, am I crazy? Any recommendations for negotiating this? Thanks and happy traveling!"

I’m wondering what should I do with my address? Since I’m going to rent only the short term, I will not have a fixed address and not sure what to do with my bank, taxes, insurance information. I suppose I have to update it? But what can serve in lieu of a permanent address?"
hztms0,12gog5,Never Going Back!,"Never going back!

I’m a personal trainer and fitness instructor and spent year working in different gyms and traveling to clients’ homes to do in person sessions. I always found it time consuming with my commutes (up to 5 hours worth of commuting a day) and that my income was maxed out doing in person training. 

Since moving online I save an insane amount of time in my day, I have time to write better programs for my clients, and I now run a virtual class that has no cap on attendance, so I can finally make a livable wage while helping more people. Not to mention I can work from anywhere in the world now!

i27lx7,3dkk19,PSA - Airlines have or are introducing limits on how many lithium batteries you are allowed,"Note: there has always been a limit on the massive 100Wh+ lithium batteries you can travel with of 2. And you needed airlines permission ahead of time to travel with them.

This new limit i am talking about is for batteries < 100 Wh which is all the stuff normal people travel with.

Couple of days ago i flew into Osaka Japan airport from Kyushu. 

You already know all lithium battery products must be carry-on, and if they can be removed they must have been.

Apart from a Macbook only thing i take carry-on is a camera bag, water flask, and wireless mouse.
With a tray each for Macbook and camera bag( Sony mirrorless and Osmo Action), and my few pocket items(powerbank, watch, keys, phone). All my batteries for cameras travel in its bag.

This time security opened each camera verify batteries where removed and then started a count of those i had.
Turns out recently airlines have introduced limits on amounts of batteries mind you this wasn't shown on signs or website when i passed thru security.

Asking in broken  japanese i discovered there was a limit of 4 lithium batteries total a passenger could take on. Powerbanks count against that limit.

Eventually i have to leave Japan so curious i checked the major international airlines i use. Sure enough if not on their forbidden items page, or baggage page this new rule was recorded somewhere obscure. My limited research has shown the limit is either 2 or 4. This information isn't easy to find, staff don't seem to know about it.

From british airways page.
>Batteries of up to 100Wh as used in mobile phones, laptops, digital cameras etc.
>In hand baggage
>Max. 4 spares per person (incl. power banks) kept in original packaging or insulated/protected from contact with metal

Now to make this worse turns out Airports also can have limits... 
According to BA if i used Heathrow it has a limit of 2. However Heathrows useless website just refers you to the British Governments restricted items list and all it said was.

>The watt-hour (Wh) rating is a measure by which lithium ion batteries are regulated. Since 2009 and 2011 respectively, manufacturers have been required to mark lithium ion batteries with the watt-hour rating.

>You can arrive at the number of watt-hours your battery provides if you know the battery's nominal voltage (V) and capacity in ampere-hours (Ah) using this calculation - Ah x V = Wh.

>This information is often marked on the battery.

>If only the milliampere hours (mAh) are marked on the battery, then divide that number by 1000 to get ampere-hours (Ah). For example, 4400 mAh / 1000 = 4.4 Ah.

The only powerbanks you should travel with must have this info clearly printed on the device.
I suggest limiting yourself to 4 to avoid issues. Should a airport have a issue I will simply show a printout of airlines page with their limit of 4 shown. 

Along with masks this sub 100Wh battery limit seems to be the new normal for those of us who fly internationally. Before you fly always check baggage restrictions and forbidden items to avoid getting caught out."

i2jxds,12nwwb,travel rum?,"While traveling and living in hotel rooms, it's not practical for me to carry multiple bottles of liquor.  I've decided that, if I can only carry one bottle of liquor, then rum is the sweet spot.  I can mix rum with either coke zero or fruity sports drinks to pair with any meal.  Prove me wrong.  But now I need to figure out my go-to rums.  

Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva was my go-to rum at my last permanent address.  I only mixed it with coke zero though - no sports drinks - so not sure how well that would mix with fruity sports drinks.  I'm not a rum snob.  I just need the rum to be decent quality, taste good and mix well with both coke zero and fruity sports drinks.

I'm also a fan of the 80/20 rule.  Ie if there's a $25 rum that people consider 80% as good as a $50 rum then I'll definitely go with the $25 rum as my travel rum.  Also, a high value rum like that should generally be readily available wherever I travel.  So are there any particular rums that you would recommend based on what I've described?"

i317hy,143qs2,"Pros & Cons of Antigua, Guatemala (travel film included)","Hey nomads, last year in december before covid I visited Antigua, Guatemala to experience the lifestyle being a digital nomad.

[I made a cool video that you can watch here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGPgGlSJHdE)

And here is my overview of the place, if you are interested on visiting it, too.

# Pros

* **Relax environment.** The guatemalan people are amongst the friendly people I've ever known, and the vibe around is totally calm.
* **Size.**   Antigua is just the right size to keep you entertained over a long   period of time. It’s the perfect walking town − we didn’t require any   transport to visit the restaurants, cultural sites, and nature   experiences.
* **Views.**  Guatemala is surrounded by  active volcanos, so anywhere you look the  views are amazing. Specially  in Atitlán as the lake is a huge massive  volcano crater.
* **Cost of living.** Prices are affordable here for accommodation, food and even the tours.
* **Food.**   Corn-based and spices, just like the mexican cuisine, the Guatemalan   food is actually delicious. And there's a great option of international   food such as pizza, gelatos and vegan —even famous fast food chains.
* **Safety.** As the tourism is big part of their economy, they take care of foreigners so you can feel calm most of the time.

# Cons

* **Wifi speed.** There's just a few places, like Selina, where you can find great wifi but besides that, it's hard to find fast speed.
* **Poverty.**   Sometimes it's difficult to see how many people are suffering with low   economy, and that also attract petty theft with pickpocketing and bag   snatching. But anyone who has lived in a developing country knows that   watching your stuff is essential regardless of where you live. It’s   certainly not special to Antigua.
* **Religious events.**   As a predominantly Catholic country, there are a lot of religious   festivals that get bigger and bigger as the weeks go on. So it's good to   see, but eventually you'll get tired of them blocking the roads or   hearing fireworks every day.

# Where to wifi

The  typical internet  connection speed in Antigua varies from 4-5 mbps for a  home connection  or a basic café connection. However, there are faster wifi speeds than  this available for the digital nomad Antigua. In some  coworking spaces,  the fastest wifi in Antigua can reach speeds up to 20 mbps.

Sometimes  wifi connections can be spotty in cafes and homes, so coworking spaces  are recommended  for days when wifi is an absolutely necessity.

Guatemala  is known for their delicious coffee beans, so digital nomads will  really appreciate their cups of joe here. The wifi in cafes is a great  amenity, but can sometimes fade in and out, which isn’t great for   internet-reliant work.

An  important thing to note is that almost  every building in Guatemala  experiences power outages from time to time  so make sure your laptop is  charged before heading to the best cafes to  work from in Antigua.

Luckily  there are tons of coworking spaces opening to accommodate the arrival  of the digital nomad in Antigua!

# The most important information needed

* **When to go:**   It's very humid most all year round, so anytime is good to go but you   can visit in December if you want to skip cold winter in other places.
* **Language:**   Spanish is the official language spoken by the majority of the   population. However, most people working in tourism and hospitality   industry speak both Spanish and English. A
* **Climate:**   Antigua has been touted the “City of External Spring” with its warm   days, however, it can get cold and fresh as soon as the sun goes down.   The wet season is between May and October. The dry season is between   November and April. May is the warmest month of the year with an   average temperature of 30°C (86°F). January is the coldest with 20°C   (68°F) when nights get very chilly.
* **Altitude:** Antigua’s altitude is 5,000 ft (1,500 m), which is mild but some people may need to adjust.
* **Safety:**   Antigua is the safest city in Guatemala, due to its tourism, so it is   generally safe. However, for women, it’s best not to walk alone at   night. Like anywhere follow extra safety precautions and have common   sense.
* **Weather**  \- Average temperatures vary very  little. Considering humidity,  temperatures feel hot all year with a  fair chance of precipitation  about half of the year. The warmest time of  year is generally early to  mid March where highs are regularly around  94.4°F (34.7°C) with  temperatures rarely dropping below 73.7°F (23.2°C)  at night.
* **Data** \- There are big companies like Movistar or Claro with relatively cheap prices for data.
* **Visa** \- Most country citizens are allowed to stay from 90 days without hassle.

Well,  hope this solves some questions... I'd totally recommend to stay  here  for a month at least. And of course, once covid gets better! I do have  even more info [on my website.](https://sergiosa.la/city/antigua)

2. Learning technical skills
3. Learning artistic skills

i3np1j,,First SE Asian country to fully open to tourists?,"So far all of SE Asia is basically closed to tourist entry. In theory Cambodia is still open but they have suspended e-visas and VOA so you need to get a visa from an embassy and they apparently aren't issuing tourist visas. 

There's some medical tourism for Malaysia and I think possibly Thailand soon but that's not viable for most. 

Bali's governor claimed the island would open to foreign tourists on 11 September but there is no official word. Indonesia is still banning foreigner tourists so I seriously doubt Bali will open in Sept. 

The Philippines recently said foreigners who already have a long term visa in their passport could enter but tourists are still banned. 

Given that a lot of SE Asian countries are big tourism markets I'm honestly surprised no one has tried to open up. I expected Thailand to at least open an island like Phuket or Koh Samui, or Vietnam to open Phu Quoc.

My office is in Washington, where I'll move when WFH ends early next year. However, I'm thinking about staying at different AirBnBs in different states during the WFH period for about a week each. 

How would this work for tax purposes? It seems like most states (eg Ohio is one I intend to visit due to family connections) taxes all earned income in the state. Let's say I move four times. Would I really have to file four separate state tax returns?

Also, not that I'm intending to dodge taxes or anything, how would each state ever know I stayed there for such a short time?"
i4jfwd,2wggxjuc,Advice for a 16-year-old,"Hey there, I’m a 16M and currently reside in the USA. I just stumbled upon this subreddit and am extremely intrigue. For a little background I’m currently working a part time lifeguarding job and have a couple thousand dollars saved up. Last month I started a website and although it is nothing big yet (check my post history to see my case study report in r/juststart) I’m hoping to grow it over the next couple of years. The goal is to eventually get paid by google or other third party companies for ad space on the site. I’ve also been looking into other options like freelance writing and YouTube. Btw, I’ve tried my hand at coding and it’s not my thing. 

I don’t necessarily have any question in particular but am just looking for some some general advice for an American teenager that is looking to pursue the digital nomad lifestyle. 

For some inspiration here are a couple questions off the top of my head:

1. How should I capitalize on my next two years of no expenses considering the fact that I have a couple thousand dollars worth of expendable cash? 

2. What do you wish you’d done to prepare for the digital nomad lifestyle when you were a teen? 

3. Is learning a second language helpful/useful for the digital nomad lifestyle?

4. Is the digital nomad lifestyle safe? 

5. What are some of your favorite places to travel to?

6. How should I approach college education with the goal of the digital nomad lifestyle in mind?

Appreciate the advice! Looking forward to the future."

Looking for:  32-45 male, also makes good money so that I'm not the bank roller.  Would prefer the outdoorsy type, as I like to spend the summers in Seattle doing all the typical outdoorsy stuff.  Would love to find a water baby into sailing, swimming, scuba diving, kayaking, etc.  I would prefer to date the expats over the locals.  Would like to move around every three months, favorite places to spend time are Seattle, the Med, and southern Africa, but I'm pretty open to other locations.  Due to having to work east coast hours, Asia is unfortunately out for me.  I'd like to head to Mexico this fall and winter.

I'm currently in Seattle for the summer, but not finding the digital nomads out here either....

- Internet connection will not be stable enough for consistent working
- Boats are not as secure as properties
- Health and safety - employers responsibility to ensure my workplace is as safe as possible

I plan to appeal the above and offer a trial period or something for the Internet connection. We will have a 4G booster with dual sims and also satellite broadband. I don't plan on going off grid and will stick to built up areas like marinas. I also plan to contest that a boat is less secure than a house as marinas have key card access, CCTV and I'm willing to deploy any other measures like alarms, locks and safes to satisfy them.

Health and safety liability is a bit more difficult to address. I'm not an expert in UK health and safety so don't know what their legal responsibilities are.

i9a4w0,n6yhq,Out of school and immediately depressed!,"I never knew life would be this difficult.

Some **brief** information about me. I am from a developing country, *Iraq*, and currently I am *24 years-old*, and also I am *married* with no kids.

How I **got into** programming. When I was a teenager I used to play a game called *GTA: San Andreas*, the game had an online multiplayer mod called *SAMP (San Andreas Multiplayer)*, people were able to script their own servers using a C like language called PAWN. And that was where my journey began. After finishing high school I decided that I want to study Computer Science, but I took this decision too quickly without even doing some local research on job availability.

My **college journey**. My *first year* was quite good, there were better students than me, but I literally kicked ass in programming class, but that was due to students not even knowing how to operate a computer. The *second year* was a bit more difficult, but I still was the best one in programming. These two years I learnt the basics of C++ and implemented some data structures using C++, such as Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, and Double Linked Lists. Now, my *third year* was better than my second, I learnt the C#.NET programming language and the Windows Forms API, I quite liked working with the Windows Forms API, and doing projects with it was enjoyable, after the year was over I did my internship locally in a govermental office, I built a windows application for them using the Windows Forms API that I grew to love, however, in production things were terrible, I had very bad code issues, hard coded some values that I shouldn't of, my database issues were endless, so the project I worked was axed, I was really **DEPRESSED**. My *fourth year* was TBH just a normal year, I did not learn anything new at all, only HTML & CSS which I already knew the basics of.

For **more than 7 years** I have not decided whether I want to specialize in *Web Development*, *Mobile Application Development* or something else entirely! I always get stuck reading books, watching videos, doing the best MOOCs out there, and the cycle just repeats itself. I know the solution, yes, it is practice, and working on real projects! But I always and **always** get stuck somewhere. I think a lot about what project to work on, what idea would be successful, I research for days, and after I settle on an idea I try to create the UI for it, then research for weeks! Eventually I get tired and leave the project all together, my problem is *lack of discipline* and the solution is to be *more productive*, ironic right? I mean I know all of my problems and the solution to them, yet I keep repeating them!

Living in a country such as **Iraq** is very difficult, I am currently dependant on my parents even though I am a grown up man and married, this makes me feel very bad, getting a job here in programming ranges from hard to very difficult, due to some very complex reasons, it is achievable though, I can still do it. One of my best choices is to work remotely for western companies or do freelance work, which I still can't do because I have **no resume** and **no projects** to show to potential employers.

I have no idea what to do, what to persuit in order to build a successful career in programming. I thought of having a mentor would help, but none exist locally, and I can't hire one online, because, guess what, we don't even have **credit cards** which makes everything even much more difficult than they already are!

Me posting this might seem immature, or maybe even stupid, because you might say it is my life and I am responsible for everything that happens in it. And I do take responsibility, I am not running away from my problems. I just need help. Serious help from **everyone** who is capable of giving me a hand and getting me out of the ditch I am currently in."

I've read many posts in the sub stating that, since you're only there with a tourist visa, you should not worry about that. However, I am an Italian citizen so I'm not sure I can just say I am a tourist. Actually, when I arrive in Europe, no visa is issued nor a stamp is placed in my passport. I just get in.

As always, thanks in advance. You are always amazingly helpful for us.

EDIT: I am not an italian resident and I have the paperwork stating that I live in South America. I vote via mail and all of that. So Italy knows  I'm not there and that I should be filing my taxes elsewere.

iaq9dq,5xmpx,Field report from Porto,"Given the working from home situation, I decided to embark on my first digital nomad experience by working in Porto for a month.

Logistically the move was very easy. There were no special measures at the airport. In Porto, everything is open, with mandatory face masks (even at restaurants/bars — you may take off your mask only when seated). I think nightlife is the only thing affected, with bars and clubs closing by midnight or 1am.

People are relaxed here, the pace of life is slow, and it feels safer than London (people are generally respectful with regards to the virus).

I'm working from the Porto I/O coworking space. Activities so far are a train ride along the Duoro river, hiking in the Peneda-Gerês National Park, and of course, port tasting.

Costs: AirBnB 700€, Coworking space €170. Lunch with soup, main and drink 6.50€.

As of today, travel to Czechia is open for Canadians, due to both countries having covid 19 relatively under control. I’m travelling primarily due to the fact that I am learning Czech( currently at A2)  and would like to immerse myself in the language as I also need a break from my home town for personal reasons. And since most of my responsibilities at home are now remote. I am thinking of heading there under the 3 month visa free period and apply for a working holiday visa the moment I land( Canada and Czech Republic have a youth mobility visa program) I have enough funds to cover my travel costs for a year(20k CAD), and I will be employed at the same time. The only concern I have right now is if I return to Canada I have to quarantine for 14 days. I wanted to know what you guys think, if this is feasible or not?

* In Australia, they require compulsory insurance cover for workers comp, public liability, and personal injury.

* lots of nature (with preference for mountains and forest over beaches)
* not completely rural – i'll need to go to pharmacies, supermarkets, etc
* lots of opportunity to hang out with locals
* non-touristy atmosphere, far away from the resorts
* access to people my own age (late 20s), either local or foreign
   * hopefully some of these are fellow LGBT folks
* good food, healthy diet and lifestyle options

Thus, after 5 years of holding it, one could ""naturalise"" in Paraguay despite not having actually spent much time living there. [SovereignMan](https://www.sovereignman.com/how-to-get-chilean-residency/) claims (in an older article) that one can do this in Chile too by getting a temporary residence visa on the basis of passive income or a certain level of salary, stay for 6 months to get permanent residency, leave, and return 5 years later to pass some exams and naturalise.

This got me curious, as digital nomads could easily move somewhere for a while (eg 6 months) before going to their next destination in order to be able to claim citizenship down the line.

Are there any countries left which still do this? I know some countries will sell citizenship or permanent residency for hundreds of thousands of dollars. But are there any which will allow someone to do it Paraguay/Chile style?"

Lastly, how do driver's licenses work? Can I just keep my current license even though the address will be wrong at the end of September? Can I get insurance in a different state than my license is in? I'd really like to maintain my citizenship in this state for the presidential elections in November.

Passport renewals have created a lot of stress for a lot of people this year.  I had something like 8 months left on my passport and was about to send it off for renewal but then the pandemic hit.  The passport office finally started renewing passports again but the wait time was an additional 2 months.  I finally received notice from the passport office last week that my passport has shipped.  

I think I'll try to start working on my passport renewal 2 years in advance next time.  Let's say another pandemic hits and worst case shuts down the passport office for 6 months.  That would still give me a full year before I hit the 6 month passport expiration buffer required to travel to some countries.  2 years seems like a lot of lead time but:

* That would have been a good plan for my current renewal cycle, knowing what I know now
* The passport renewal process is fairly inexpensive.  < $200 for a passport good for 10 years.   For me, peace of mind is definitely worth an extra $20-$40 over the course of 10 years

I was advised to by the German embassy in New Zealand to get proof that I had been in New Zealand the whole time from NZ immigration. I booked a flight on Singapore airlines transiting through Singapore then to Frankfurt.

Right away when trying to check in my bag I had to explain my situation, show them the proof that I had been in New Zealand for more than 6 months, they asked to see the email from the German embassy and the website that detailed that I would be allowed in because I was coming from a low risk country. They had to get call over another employee and another person who I presume was a manager before they let me through. 

The layover in Singapore was easy, Singapore air was very organized, they kept layovers separated from passengers flying into Singapore and kept everyone distanced and had a designated waiting area just for layover passengers, when it was time to catch the next flight we were escorted from the waiting area to the flight.

In Frankfurt I presented my proof that I had been in New Zealand, I don't know if I wasn't entirely clear, but the agent asked me a ton of questions about where I had been, and why I was in Germany, and where I would be staying, and for how long, and seemed to have a lot of reservations about letting me in, but he did eventually let me in.

However I've thought a lot about changing careers so that my earning potential is higher. The last couple of years I've been slowly studying programming in JavaScript and web development, which I like because I enjoy solving problems. I've thought about joining a full time bootcamp to elevate my learning curb and then try to make the jump into remote work, which I am hopeful because of Covid more remote jobs will be available than ever before. Would anybody on here offer me any advice? Should I just stay with my current job or do any of you think it would be worth it to go for this change now?

igjdgc,r8rfi,2-3 months Digital Nomad in Balkans,"Hi guys, 24 year old from London here. 

&#x200B;

So coming from London and working in a tech company, I have the freedom to work anywhere in/around the Europe area till the end of the year.

&#x200B;

I am thinking about 2-3 months spent through the Balkan region. I haven't been to any of the Balkan countries so thought this would be a good chance.

&#x200B;

My priorities/notes: 

1. Cheap
2. Social scene. Clubs, etc are open with this pandemic... Women are also open (be it through tinder or otherwise. I know cultural difference plays a part here so let me know). 
3. Gyms open too would be nice but not an absolute must. 
4. Wifi connection! I will be working \~8 hours every weekday.
5. I am planning to depart each city Sunday and arrive in each city on the same day Sunday so that I get a full weekend in the city I am departing, as I am working weekdays so I only really get to check out cities weeknights and weekends. 

My rough itinerary looks like: 

Arrive Ljubljana Slovenia 28 Aug. 1 week spent here.

Arrive Zagreb Croatia 6 September. 1 week spent here.   
Arrive Split Croatia 13 September. 2 weeks spent here.

Arrive Bosnia Sarajevo 27 September. 2 weeks spent here.

Arrive Serbia Belgrade 11 October. 2 weeks spent here.

Arrive Bulgaria Sofia 25 October. \~3 weeks spent here.

Arrive Romania Bucharest 15 November. \~ 3 weeks spent here.

If you can make any suggestions to my itinerary based on my preferences listed above, please do. Or suggest an alternative itinerary - preferably not one within Western Europe as I've been there quite a bit and it's pricier. Poland was nice with my preferences the last time I went... I am also considering Bulgaria --> Romania --> Moldova --> Ukraine --> Belarus??

Now, I'm in a new place (northern France) and looking around and it seems everywhere is on a monthly system with very few offering (very high) hourly or daily rates. I have a few friends here whose offices are closing and who are being moved into shared coworking spaces or coworking offices. 

It feels very much like this is the new coworking model here at least. I guess they're ""disrupting"" the traditional office rental sphere, but from the coworking spaces I've visited so far, they're just cloning the same vibe with hipper wallpaper. You don't sign a lease anymore and it's cheaper for small companies maybe, but my friends aren't too happy about going from their own space to an open office with dozens of other people. For me as a more nomadic person, it feels like all the old options have gone away. I wonder if it's because the hourly/daily model wasn't profitable or the monthly/annually one is just more profitable.

Anyway, it's kind of sad to see what seemed to be once a youthful, revolutionary, ""let's change the world"" kind of idea becoming just another tired, mainstream and bureaucratic part of the grind.

ihvehi,4kbx2zij,Bali's closed till next year. : ( Where to go now?,"My partner and I had been tentatively planning to go to Bali for 6 months in November. They decided today to cancel the reopening until at least 2021. We were living in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, Mexico for six months until March and got stuck in the US during a brief trip after they closed the borders and a lot of flights were shut down. We've been hiding out in this remote New England town this entire time and would love to get out of this country again, especially since the covid risk is a lot higher here.

I've lived in Spain, France, and Norway (the latter being my favourite), as well as Cameroon, which I didn't like, one, from having developed serious health issues, but also culturally as I was constantly expected to conform to local customs without having been there very long, and lectured for not giving proper greetings, etc (which I feel was partly sexist), and I was in a small remote town with only a handful of other aid workers. We've been thinking about Caribbean islands, and from reading a little, I feel like some of those have a similar culture with low privacy and where people are very extroverted and will talk to you in the street, come up to your house, etc which just freaks me out a little bit. Though maybe Bali would be a little bit similar (from what I remember of Eat Pray Love) but nicer? I loved living in Mexico because people were a little more reserved like me, but the negative part is it was harder to make friends. We didn't want to go back to Vallarta now since covid is pretty bad there.

We were really interested in Bali because it's kind of a digital nomad capital, and we would like to meet more digital nomads, and because of the affordability. There's only a handful of places open to Americans now... From a National Geographic article...

""As of August 3, destinations open to U.S. visitors include Albania, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, the Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Brazil, Cambodia, Croatia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, French Polynesia, Ireland, Jamaica, the Maldives, Mexico, North Macedonia, Rwanda, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Serbia, Sint Maarten, Sri Lanka, St. Barts, St. Martin, Tanzania, Turkey, Turks and Caicos, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates (but only Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah), the United Kingdom, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

* Extreme minimalist.
* Working 30 hours a week in supermarket.
* No real tied-down responsibilities.

3. what was the result of you acquiring those skills?

Unfortunately, working from home means being within driving distance of the office if necessary. It can be near any one of the offices in the US. It's a contingency issue - if a computer breaks or the internet goes out, we need a backup plan because we need to be online at all times during business hours (nature of the job)

If I was able to eventually convince my boss that I could do this job anywhere in the world, it would require me to assure him that my presence would not be affected. So far I figured I'd need 1) a backup laptop & hardware setup, 2) a backup internet connection (5G or Starlink), and 3) reliable logistics (shipping, flights, etc).

ikyasx,4w8jjblc,Stay in USA or move abroad for financial independence/job opportunity/cost of living?," I've been debating whether staying in the US or moving abroad would be better for financial independence/job opportunities. The cost of living in the US is reaching absurd levels in the big cities, in the suburbs it is a bit cheaper, but then you have to commute, take a lower salary, have less job opportunities, and it's boring/there's less to do.

The USA is more predictable and overall more safe than most countries in the world. However, with the current cultural environment, the big cities seem more dangerous than a lot of the countries the US media likes to hate on; also, the dating environment in the US has reached as absurdities as well as most females have highly elevated expectations compared to females from other countries.

Overall, I have more pride in the USA more than any other country, but it is getting really hard to make a living when no job pays over 13 an hour, you have to fill out 3000 job applications to get 1 interview, and a small house costs 350000. I wonder if other countries have these absurd indeed requirements where you have to have 10 certifications a masters, 5 years of experience, and start at 40k?

I've debated Sweden, but the taxes seem ridiculous. Ukraine, Philippines, and Vietnam have been my other choices. However, even though the cost of housing is low in these countries, I think the reason why is because the salaries are a lot lower than the U.S. Even then though, it still seems easier to buy a house over there, and you don't see many people that are over levered on debt in those countries. I like Ukraine the most of these countries because it seems like language barrier would be higher in Philippines and Vietnam, and that would make it harder to find a job. Has anyone else had an issue with the language barrier in those countries, and did you have a hard time finding a job.

Lastly, would it be easier or harder to find a job in these countries/or other countries abroad compared to the US?

And how are the salaries in these countries and would it be easier to make a living in these countries or the U.S. and how would you rate these countries from best to worst for financial Independence FIRE lifestyle, cost of living, and quality of life?

USA, Ukraine, Sweden, Vietnam, Philippines?"

il3jnv,66vud,What’s the best option for Car Insurance in the US for rentals?,"I’m a US citizen, I spend most of the year outside the US, but occasionally will be going back to the US a few months at a time. Previously I’ve booked cars through Priceline for 2 weeks at a time, and gotten Priceline’s collision damage coverage (last time I rented I was able to get reimbursed for a $60 glass chip from a rock that got kicked up from that insurance). This was in WI, and I couldn’t really find a better price than $200/week.

I’m not entirely sure if that’s the best route to go, plus there are some travel cards that provide rental insurance if I used them to book. My confusion stems from the fact that when I read the fine print on those cards, the insurance is intended as secondary; and the assumption is that the driver owns a car and has at least liability insurance for that vehicle. Apparently this is also the case when it comes to the insurance offered by Priceline/Turo/rental companies.

My main concern is obviously to deal with catastrophic situations, but I would also like it to deal with sub $1k situations just as well. I have the cash on hand to take care of any high deductible plans, but I hate the idea of paying month to month/annual fees for things I’m not using. 

So is my best bet to book directly with the rental company and pay for the most expensive insurance option?"

I've been investigating travel insurance and I'm not seeing any consensus about the best option.  


For example, there's [https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3nu8t1/a\_guide\_to\_buying\_travel\_insurance\_yes\_you\_should/](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3nu8t1/a_guide_to_buying_travel_insurance_yes_you_should/) \-- here people claim that it's always a good idea, and you should have a health limit of 2.5m+. Searching [http://www.insuremytrip.com/](http://www.insuremytrip.com/) , even the most expensive insurance only seems to offer 250k or 500k max.   


Then there's the question of uncertain end date. I heard SafetyWing offers more of a subscription model, but apparently it does not currently cover medical care if you catch covid: [https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/fhd3kf/usa\_places\_the\_entire\_world\_on\_level\_3\_travel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/fhd3kf/usa_places_the_entire_world_on_level_3_travel/)  
(not blaming them, and I will be in remote places far away from cities and other hotspots, but still, not ideal)  


Finally there's this incredible story that makes it clear that, at least some travel insurance is basically worthless: [https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/8zjj9v/what\_travel\_insurance\_really\_means\_warning/](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/8zjj9v/what_travel_insurance_really_means_warning/)  


So, what **is** a good option for worldwide coverage for frequent travelers / digital nomads? Particularly medical. I have chase sapphire reserve and that covers some of the small stuff with flights. The thing I want to avoid most is 5 or 6 figure medical bills.   


(If it matters, the upcoming trip is to the UK. All of my travels revolve around Europe, UK, Canada, US, and rarely Argentina/Nepal.)"
ilgfby,12nwwb,vpn strategies?,"I need a good VPN strategy.  I found the following url which lists the best free VPN services for 2020:

https://www.techradar.com/vpn/best-free-vpn

However, it seems like a lot of these VPN services actually charge money.  Ie the service may only offer a 30-day free trial.  Or the service may offer a few tiers, with the lowest tier having low availability and/or speed.

I'm currently staying at a hotel.  I have T-Mobile and Visible mobile.  Both service providers offer good reception in the lobby but the data speed in the actual hotel room can be extremely variable, often with speeds well under 1gbps.  However, the speed of my hotel WiFi is consistently good with data speeds consistently over 20gbps.

So connecting to my hotel WiFi through a VPN service is going to be my best bet for my current scenario and probably similar scenarios in the future.  Can you provide any feedback regarding your experience with different VPN services?"
ilgyoz,7itkhj2a,This is how you can TRY to get more clients on Upwork; even if you don't have Upwork! 😄,"1. Bid every single day, even if you have jobs. Still bid every single day. Because maybe they could take a week or 2 before they make their final decision. *That way you always have jobs.*
2. Only bid on jobs that were posted in the last 24 hours.
3. Try to avoid jobs with more than (15-20) bids already. *Unless it's really good.*
4. Only bid on jobs that are over $100 even for small projects.
5. Always bid on jobs that are fixed price if you bring direct value to the business hiring you, e.g. Your work might double their sales or something like that. And bid Hourly for any  “assembly-line” types of projects that stand a high chance to be automated over time... Like Transcription, Admin, etc.
6. Never copy & paste your proposal. \**Very important!* Look for any personal information that they provided like; Name, age, location, link to a website, Business name, industry, etc.

# Bonus hack, for people who were rejected by Upwork but still have access to the platform's dashboard:

Chances are, most clients in your industry are not posting their ""job opening"" copy in one platform - **At least we hope so -** and if so, then this means that they most likely will not re-assemble the copy they post but just Copy & paste it in the different channels since humans are lazy ;)

With that said, make it a habit to copy every job offer - after checking for a website or an email in the copy that you could use instead - and paste it on any online plagiarism website of your choice (I personally use: [https://1text.com/](https://1text.com/))

This will help you find any other platform online with the exact same ""text"" and this will allow you to possibly apply on that other platform without the restrictions and competition you get from Upwork.

# Bonus hack of the bonus hack🙃:

Just copy and paste this little piece of JavaScript into your bookmarks bar, and anytime you want to “edit” a web page just click it:  *javascript:document.body.contentEditable = 'true'; document.designMode='on'; void 0*

This will allow you to ""edit"" the Upwork front end copy and actually copy the text... Since they do not allow you to do so if you're not approved yet.

I hope this helps someone out there.

**P.S. This could also be done on any other Freelance sites.**

**P.P.S. If they have a profile picture then copy the image address & Reverse image Google search it, hopefully, you can find their other profiles, and reach out to them there... or use that information to stand out.**"

iljgd0,l56tc,Wintering in SoCal,"Well, it finally happened, folks. I finally landed my dream job situation: great pay, uses my college degree and is 100% remote. It only took a damned global pandemic for it to happen. 

I live in Iowa. I own a house and I HATE the winters. With how the pandemic is going, looks like I’ll be spending most of it indoors. 

Since that’s making me panic, I think what I’ll do is find some temporary living someplace warmer. 

I’ve always wanted to spend some time in SoCal. I have friends in the tech industry out there, and that culture interests me, as does the creative community forged by the film industry. 

Even if those things are locked down by the pandemic, at least I would be able to take a walk outside, instead of shivering under blankets.

ilqtrw,,"$120,000 and not sure what to do - Any advice?","Hi,

I need your advice. Years ago, I was lucky enough to make a very good chunk of money by working hard and being at the right place at the right time. I still have savings of about $120,000 from this on my bank account. What I was doing back then doesn't work anymore, so I can't just keep doing that (it wasn't anything scammy or illegal, FYI).

Social pressure and not sure what I wanna do with my life, I returned to corporate life a couple months ago. I thought ok, you're already 32, it's time to settle own and get a 'real' job. Spoiler alert: I'm not happy. I don't like corporate life, I never have. Working 40+ hours a week in an office just isn't for me. I wanna leave again, live in other places. 

So here's the thing: I have $120,000 on my bank account, so I could just quit and leave. But of course I worry about the future. I know I can't live off those savings forever. The question is: How can I use that money to build myself a future where I never have to return to corporate life and can do something I enjoy doing (more or less at least)?

I'm open to anything really. I have an online marketing background, but to be honest I'm kinda tired of it. I've been considering to try becoming a writer (of novels) because I know I'm good at that. At the same time I know it's not easy to make good money as a writer. I've also considered investing in something but I don't know what (I don't wanna buy property). 

What would you do if you had $120,000 and never wanted to return to corporate life? By the way, I'm not going to react to any messages trying to 'help' me investing that money.

Thanks!"
ilr8if,sfqrt2r,Experience with living in La Reunion,"Did any of you live in La Reunion? Since I don’t think it will be possible to spend the winter in SEA I’ve been looking at alternatives. La Reunion is part of the EU, thus no visa needed (at least in my case). The timezone GMT+4 is also EU friendly. It also has warm weather, good diving spots and amazing nature - ticking a lot of my boxes. I also found a couple of co-working spaces on Google maps which had however only a handful of reviews each. The airbnbs don’t seem to be too pricey either, you can get a nice flat with pool, AC for around 900€ a month. The general cost of living seems to be on a Western European standard, so not a place you’d go to if you want to save money. There are daily one-way flights from Paris for around 200€. 

Some things I’d be interested in knowing: 

&#x200B;

* Is there a quarantine or test requirement? (Would be very reasonable and I’d be happy to do that, on their tourism website it says nothing in particular about that)
* Has someone more first hand experience of living there and the associated costs? 
* Do people speak English or would I be lost with my shitty French? 
* Is there a nomad community? Couldn’t find much online but could be also because “La Reunion” is not a SEO friendly name for a location ;)
* And most importantly: How decent is the Internet speed? Couldn’t find super reliable information on that either. 

(As a side note: I’m not interested in European overseas territories in the Caribbean nor nomad visas due to the onset of the hurricane season.)"

Background:
I live in a city (USA) that has been dramatically impacted by both the riots and Covid-19. It’s not great - I’m angry at the city, weary of the crime spike/aggression, and I don’t like the perpetually boarded up windows. The concept of spending an entire winter here quarantined in an apartment is giving me angst. So I’m debating throwing it all in storage, and leaving when my lease ends to airbnb it. My work is remote till next summer.

...however, that’s my entire game plan. I’m worried that I’m setting myself up for extreme loneliness. (I have a huge social network in my current city. I’ve made big moves before, but I have no idea how you make friends during Covid.)"

While there are some posts here on Argentina and Colombia, I guess I'd also like to know if anyone has been to both places and has a preference of one over the other, and why.

imlivb,12nwwb,options for usa cities without smoke right now?,"I'm currently in Reno, NV.  The California wildfires have made reno so smoky that the surrounding mountains are not visible.  A couple of days ago, the smoke cleared up, I could see the mountains and the tiny trees on the mountains in full color.  But the smoke was only clear for about a day and now the air is smoky again and I can't see the mountains.

One of the main reasons why I like to be a DN is  to be able to travel around so I can ride my bike year round.  Denver had 6 months of winter for the last 2 years and I was miserable.  It's not healthy to ride my bike in thick smoke so I'd like to find a good city that I can drive to from Reno in < 3 days which is not currently smoky.

I read online that Denver is currently getting smoke from CA wildfires as well as it's own fires so Denver is probably not the best place to be right now for clean air either?  So what cities would you recommend within a 3-day drive from Reno?  Some cities that come to mind are:

San Diego
Seattle
Las Vegas

I've been doing research. My ideal place, which may not exist in USA, would be somewhere:

* 'Good' re covid situation. Trending down or already low
* Pedestrian friendly. I do not want to have to depend on a car for daily life (Goodby 95% of the country). I have a license and can drive, but I don't want to have to buy a car, I'd prefer using e.g. Turo app or Uber on demand
* Affordability. Coming from an expensive coastal city anywhere is going to be as expensive or less expensive than where I am now. But it would be nice to be able to save a little more.
* Warm in the winter months (Beaches are nice too!).

I know that my two suggestions in the title do not meet all these criteria. But where does? I'm flexible, these are just nice to haves.

RE Miami Beach or Honolulu. I did some searching on AirBnb and I can get a studio in South Beach or Waikiki for \~$1500 pcm which is less than my regular rent. Hawaii is notoriously expensive but housing is the big one. I'm guessing the reputation comes from food and other costs then?

It looks like Hawaii is currently pretty closed - the beach, the parks but that might change soon. No one knows. Miami looks like it's more open and lively.

If restricting myself to Miami Beach can I get by without a car? Or is it going to get difficult? Same for Honolulu? 

Another bullet point which I never added explicitly. Dating. I've found being a single straight man in SF difficult. I've lived in many cities, location does matter and this place has been hard. I always felt at least moderately good looking before moving to SF a few years ago, but this place has really lowered by self esteem. So it would be nice to find some matches wherever I end up. 

Does anyone have experience living in either Miami or Honolulu? What's it like? How about my ideal criteria above? Any other suggestions?"

I like to travel a lot and spend several months in other countries between Asia and Europe so having a company handling my paperwork would be nice, eventually a post box scanning and sending me my mail by email.  
I have my eyes on Malta, Estonia, Georgia, and Spain.

Malta seems to have low taxes around 25%, Estonia confuses me a bit with their system and 33% social taxes, Georgia seems to try to attract people and are pretty chill and low taxes, Spain because I saw a lot of people speaking about it. Japan was top on my list as well but... The country is kind of close atm and needs a LOT of paperwork.

Anyone is a similar situation? kind of like digital nomad but with a residency?"
ip7ep8,6f2t22m8,Dating Nomad and Dating Local..............,"**Does anybody else think about these things??**

**I'm sure there's a few more that you all have thought of and encountered... I'd be interested to see...**

* Hanging around nomad hotspots and bumping into that special someone - It's great at first, lots in common, tons of shared interests, an instant love buddy to explore the town / city / country you're in
* Deciding if you're going to change your travel plans to be with that someone a bit longer and wondering, ""Is it *worth it* to sacrifice my plans for this person who I just met? I wouldn't want to *give too much* to be with this person when we don't *really* know each other enough to justify changing for them...""
* Wondering - ""She / He probably has some other guy / gal in the next city, in the next country, is probably still talking to them and making plans and still not quite over the last wonderful fling from the last wonderful fling the last wonderful season ago...""
* If from the same country as you (even though you're nomad-ing): It's annoying that they have XYZ political opinion that is unique to the domestic politics of where I'm from. It would be easier / better / more interesting if they were from a different country where our political differences could be discussed with a bit more objectivity and at least be more fresh / new / exciting to discuss
* If from a different country as you (as you are nomad-ing): This person doesn't really understand the internal domestic politics of my birth country, they're just erroneously applying their country's and culture's standards to my own and unfortunately are really just not understanding each position fully... X issue in my country doesn't mean the same thing in their country
* Also if from a different country: Wow, I never thought about X aspect of my own culture in that way, it's such an interesting, intriguing, and captivating perspective on something I took for granted. It's beautiful the way they appreciate the simplest things that to me are normal and to be expected
* Also if from a different country: Wow, they complain so much about my own culture and *think* they know so much but really they've never spent enough time and don't really appreciate the good things and the bad things about this place... It's so much work to explain and show them what it's all about
* Age differences: This girl / guy is too young, they're just out partying and having fun all the time and really not into anything serious or long-lasting... They'll probably just go back home after their gap year and totally abandon this nomad life experiment
* Age differences: This girl / guy is too old, they're financially successful enough to be nomad-ing but by now have so much baggage and issues and maybe they're just escaping their real life problems...
* Men have it so much easier, they can just go to any country and every girl is instantly into them because they're exotic and different and more attractive and the women are younger with no nomad-ing responsibilities thinking they must be extra successful because they're traveling
* Women have it so much easier, men just throw themselves at them because there are so few women nomads out there and every man is instantly into them because they're exotic and different and more attractive than the local women and they get all of the attention
* Dating a local: Wow this person is so amazing! I wonder if they would be interested in living the nomad life with me... But if they're not already doing so, would I really want to be the one who convinces them to do it? And if we start traveling together then the whole dynamic will change, won't it?
* Dating a local: Wow this person is so amazing! I could totally live here in their country and learn the language and be a part of this culture - but would the host country ever truly accept me? What if we had kids, would their friends and family see my kids as one of their own or an outsider who isn't *really* one of them? Would I really want to deal with all of those things? Maybe I can convince them to come back to my country when it's time to settle down
* I wonder if they really like me for me or if it's because they somehow think being with a foreigner is better for their prospects?
* Do I really want to put all of this time and energy into learning their language / culture / dealing with all of this bureaucracy? It could all just end.. Oh, it'd be way easier to date someone from my country / travel with someone from my country
* Let's create a nomad dating app... Oh wait, it's a few women getting all of the attention from an overabundance of nomad men because there are so few women... Somehow this feels unfair, maybe I can just meet a local?
* Let's meet someone organically in this nomad hotspot... Oh wait, the guys came here to meet the local women and aren't into meeting someone *too much* like their own culture
* Oh wow, we've been doing this nomad thing for a long time - I'm tired of this fling and just having fun and one night stands and flirting with strangers thing... Wish I could find someone more genuinely into having a relationship
* Oh wow, relationships are hard anyway and now we're adding all of this nomad-ing complexity and logistics and... Oh they already booked a ticket to another country and their visa is running out but mine is still valid here / or mine isn't valid in their country or region... What can we do??? Ohh
* The country I want to go to / they want to go to is too expensive
* The country they want to go to is more dangerous than I would prefer
* The country I want to go to is more ""adventurous"" and less developed and they need more consistent, easily accessible internet... but I'm on a sabbatical and can take a real vacation right now and not a ""work from the road"" lifestyle
* These language differences are really a lot more difficult than I thought... A lot of very funny misunderstandings... and some *not* so funny misunderstandings
* Are we having cultural misunderstandings or simply different personality misunderstandings?
* Is she pretending to understand everything I'm saying? Or does he really, truly understand what I'm trying to say?
* Are they *really* understanding my clever jokes? Oh.. you don't understand that pop culture reference? I thought everybody knew about XYZ thing...
* You don't love peanut butter / vegemite / Asterix comics / regional or country-specific thing... How could I ever love someone like that! 😅
* You love that I'm from X country... but actually I left my home country because I'm really not like *those* people, stop saying that I'm like them, I want to be like people from *your* country!"

ipi62r,xni1x,Moving country and keeping UK employer - HR says no due to tax reasons,"Hi guys,

I understand this is a nomad thread but I am sure a lot of you have and do stay in places long enough or have other reasons to become officially tax resident in your host country.

I've had a couple of weird conversations with HR today. Long story short, I'm a full-time employee for a UK business and I've had buy-in from key colleagues and managers to let me work remotely from Portugal. However, HR has turned around today and has told me it's not possible due to not having a means of dealing with the tax side of things in Portugal.

In my mind, I never anticipated this to be a big issue? They speak about how they need to have an entity in Portugal for payroll etc. I don't trust this is the case as I'd imagine I would have heard about it. I was actually under the impression it was the EMPLOYEE's responsibility to pay tax to whichever host country they are in and not the employer.

Can anyone shed some light on this, please? Are they right in what they are saying?  


Be interested to know what actually needs to be done to make this work.

One thing I haven't seen is regarding legal risks to our employers back home.

I work as a full-time permanent for a company in Australia, and I want to protect my employer from any exposure or legal issues, because I'm working remotely on visas that do not explicitly/legally allow remote work; working holiday, student, tourist.

Are there any risks or implications I am exposing my company to, by doing this? Will the Australian Tax Office sound an alarm bell when I declare I was receiving full-time salary into my Australian bank account, while staying overseas the whole time?

Order of the Visas I will take:
1. 18 months Working Holiday Visa
2. 2 years Student Visa
3. Wealth Visa(if I want a yearly tourist visa), otherwise, I'd stay in Australia for most of the year, and take normal tourist visa here and there.

A spouse visa would solve my concerns, but I can't count on that, and I plan to live in Australia for the long term until I change my mind 😂."
isoicj,3ta3d67m,What are some goals I can set for myself to make sure my career & skills develop over a period of 4 years?,"I've been consuming content from digital nomads forever and I've always viewed it as something just out of my reach because I kind of don't understand it. Freelance seems hard on its own, even harder as someone who works exclusively online. But I'm 18, I just moved out, I'm not going to college, and I need to start diverting my energy to something productive and that I care about (ie this career/lifestyle). I have a full-time job that I don't care about, but it's good income while I do this.

So because I'm 18 and most of my friends are just starting college, I'm frequently burdened with the sense of guilt and doubt that I'm not investing my time wisely because I'm not going to school. I know it's bad to compare yourself to other people, but I think maybe instead of just pushing down the shame, I should use it to push myself. What can I do in the next 4 years to make sure I'm at least at the same professional level as my peers once they get out of school? What are some tangible goals I can work towards?

ita1i4,vnofg7m,A disgruntled Nomad Capitalist client's rant ...,"According to the Google Search results, someone (anonymous) seems quite dissatisfied with the Nomad Capitalist (NC) service. He even put up a website to complain about it.

NC is a boutique consultancy helping 7 -and 8 figure entrepreneurs (i.e. making millions and dozens of millions) move their businesses (and themselves) abroad. NC are quite upfront about the fact that they do not really cater to people who make less than that.

So, [Is Nomad Capitalist a scam?](https://nomadcapitalistscam.com/)

Apparently, they charge S$500 for a first skype consultation (one hour with Andrew). If you want them to go through your information and make a personalized proposal, they will charge you $8500 (two hours with Andrew).

The client is incensed that he was suggested to spend $60,000 to $100,000 in the personalized proposal, probably on second passports and/or residence permits abroad ""not including enormous costs of residency"", which is undoubtedly about buying houses and other real estate in the right places.

Apparently, Andrew also recommends buying real estate in Georgia and to hold enough precious metals in your portfolio. Georgia (the country) is hot nowadays. There are lots of people recommending the place.

Concerning ""All of his suggestions involve you renouncing whatever your citizenship"", that is probably a bit of an exaggeration because only Americans can save substantially on taxes by renouncing citizenship. Everybody else can just keep their citizenship and will stop being a tax subject of their native country by removing themselves sufficiently/completely from the territory.

Someone who makes dozens of millions of dollars a year in income, i.e. the target demographic of NC, is undoubtedly used to paying $500/hour in consultancy fees, and $10,000 for a final recommendation report. I do not see why this would be a scam.

I remember working as an freelance consultant on a project in the past on how to handle realized and unrealized losses and gains on currency exchange in the organization's books. Both Ernst & Young and Oracle charged tens of thousands of dollars for their recommendation report, which were each just a few pages long.

Concerning ""There’s some good info in the PDF but it’s not any different than what you can get from reading his blog"", that is undoubtedly true, but a 7 or 8 -figure entrepreneur will not make time to read his blog and piece the relevant bits back together. It is probably cheaper for him to get the information nicely summarized and personalized for $10,000, rather than to do this job by himself.

I don't think that the NC business model is a scam. What do you guys think?"

iwgb7v,v35ji,Looking for a bit of life advice...,"Hello! So I'm a 19 year old university student in second year studying Philosophy, a degree which is known for opening so many doors... ha.....

Now, alongside my studies I have been working on a little E-commerce print on demand store that I have to admit is not doing very well (although, while writing this post, I just got a sale! haha funny world...). It is original but it is not sustainable currently. I am having a blast with it though, apart from the mounting Shopify bills.

I am flickering between two **ideals**: carrying on with my degree until a PhD and doing research OR settling with a Bachelors and starting my own business, from which I can work remotely as I travel. I'm at a very intimidating part of my life and not sure what I want to do with it or how I would go about it. I like my degree, but I don't know if I am engaged enough for actually saving the world with it...

Although I am studying a Philosophy degree I have always been very interested in computers, and my store is actually pretty well built. I do not have any experience with programming however. The reason for writing this post isn't for someone to give me a magic answer to solve all my worries (although...) but just to tell me how you got to where you are now and if you relate to me.

I wish you all good travels :)"

iwoyzy,1264cqs,Best environments for DNs in their early 20s europe.,"Hey guys. I'm extremely excited as recently I was fortunate enough to get a fully remote job and the company seems pretty flexible on me working abroad as long as I work the same hours. I'm from Ireland so this means probably +/-1 hour from gmt so most of Europe and some of Africa which I'm not opposed to. 

I'm 22 so I'm still quite young but I'd love to work abroad. I have some ideals that I'm looking for in a location. I love being around people, I like to be active and I have a penchant for the odd party. 

I've been looking at coliving spaces which I really like the idea of. From what I can tell however they tend to attract a slightly older crowd. I'm not opposed to this at all but I think I'd rather be spending a lot of time with people in and around my own age. Some of them provide surfing facilities and the likes which I find very attractive. 

Alternatively they said I can move to the US on a more permanent basis if I want to so that's also an option. 

I was wondering if you guys would know of anything that fits these ideals? Any recommendations of something that might suit?

Obviously due to the pandemic things are pretty uncertain at the moment but it does give me some time to save up some cash and make a plan. Really love this sub and thanks in advance for giving a read."
ix2qhk,x5zm1df,Is Brazil a dangerous place to be as a white guy during the pandemic,"I just got done successfully traveling the rockies all summer, in very high risk states, and totally covid-free by being very precautious. Or maybe it was because I caught Coronavirus back in February, and probably still have some immunity. So I'm ready to try doing the same thing in Latin America, but really more than anything I'm afraid of the violence. I decided to book an AirBnB for 1 month in Playa Del Carmen, since I realized that tourists are still going there so I won't stick out that much. After that, I was thinking of going to Rio De Janero since they'll let me in. I've asked a Brazilian friend of mine what she thinks, and she honestly is very worried that I'll be robbed. First of all because it's a generally dangerous place, but also because there aren't many other tourists there. I'll be the only gringo, and they'll assume that I have money.

So I was thinking that maybe I'll just do Rio for a long weekend, and hopefully there's somewhere safer that I can get a 1 month rental & leave most of my valuable belongings?"
ixdab6,7htrcpgy,Laptop suggestions,"Hello! I need help deciding on what laptop/computer to get for online work. I work mainly as a writer/editor and I also run a small NGO with my partner. Having said that, the programs I use the most are Microsoft Word and the Google app suite (docs, sheets, drive, etc). I have a very tight budget (~350 dollars max) and I am looking at getting either a Teclast f7 plus or a Lenovo s340 Chromebook.  They have their own pros and cons. For the Teclast f7 plus, my pros are its a windows computer so Microsoft Office is easily compatible. It also has good storage space and it is essentially a “proper” laptop. My only concern is the fact that to me, it seems like a not so established Chinese brand and I don’t know how reliable it will be as a device long-term. On the other hand, I like the idea of the Chromebook since I work a lot with Google Suite for our NGO as well. I do worry about compatibility, particularly with Microsoft Word. Another issue is storage on the Chromebook is very limited. I have no problem augmenting with a microSD card but I need to know if doing so will slow the device down. I am mostly leaning towards the chromebook still but I can’t seem to commit fully (i’m a bit scared to, i think hehe) So those are my concerns. Any tips?"

Has anyone used a service to watch their home while they’re away? It’s not a larger house - 2400 sq ft in the SF Bay Area. I think we should have someone check in on it once every week or two to sort the mail and make sure nothing has been disturbed? We have SimplySafe security but it has its flaws. 

We’d turn off the water and drain the hot tub. We’d leave the heat off and set the AC to only cool to 80F or so.

I was thinking about working from Hawaii for a month or two and then going to Korea for a month or two (so in total, about 3-4 months out of California where I'm a resident and my company is located). I'm moving my stuff to a storage, and will be using my brother's address in california as my permanent address while I'm out of state.

I was just planning on paying normal california taxes and not alerting HR originally (my boss and my team knows about my plan) because they are pretty conservative and possibly will not let me leave. Should I let HR know? How do you guys deal with tax issues like this? I was just planning on paying california taxes since I won't have a permanent residence in any other state for those 3-4 months, and my permanent address will be in California. If i have to, I don't mind paying two state taxes. Would the company have an issue with a worker out of state?

j4wklo,p3zais,Ia your digital nomad life coming at the cost of an intellectually stimulating environment?,"First and foremost, I dont have too much experience in se digital nomad life. 

Back then, I did interrupt my masters to briefly join a fully remote start up, during which time I worked out of Chiang mai, Thailand. But thats pretty much it. I have also lived abroad for about 3 years, but I always had a (big city) base. 

Now, with my current job I could easily switch to a remote contract. So that temptation is back. There are many countries on my list and - even better - having seasonal bases sounds like a dream.

But one thing I vividly recall from my time in Chiang mai is the impression that many digital nomads are either (1) very spiritual yogis, (2) entirely focused on accessing cheap alcohol and seemingly endless hook up opportunities or (3) simply dumb. 

It seemed as if I had to trade an intellectually stimulating environment for one with great weather, so much (nature) to explore and a fun, new culture. 

So here comes my question: if I were to take up the digital nomad life once again - what place would you recommend for having an intellectually stimulating environment WITH great weather, a fun environment and all that.

Is there such a thing? Or what are your 'coping mechanisms'? An entirely digital network of friends etc? 

Because it does seem as if most people that are smart, intellectually honest and curious are focusing on any kind of passion project that is usually the conventionally designed job in one of a few, select cities."

They provided us with a company laptop so we can work remote, however, the laptop runs a VERY restricted version of Linux. We cannot access the web from the OS on the laptop. Instead, we connect directly to a virtual machine hosted in god knows where. We can ONLY connect via an ethernet connection, and not wifi. They say it's ""too unstable,"" and thus I have to be hardwired in. I'd like to travel around a bit and be able to work remotely, but I know tons of hotels no longer have ethernet in the rooms, they only have wifi. In addition, almost every single hotel I use has a splash screen where you have to accept the terms and conditions before you can log on. This wouldn't work for me, as I can't access the web to agree to the terms. I was thinking that I could get around this by spoofing a MAC address on a separate device but I'm not sure how to do that or if a device like what I'm looking for would even allow that to happen. I am really looking for a device that can take a wifi signal and convert it to a hardwired ethernet connection so I can connect with my computer. Any advice you guys have on the matter would be amazing!
Thank you!"

I'm thinking in the context of wanting to take a break from travelling and spending a couple of months or actually spending a couple of months in each base every year.

Do you buy your place, assuming you can afford it, or rent a new place every time? Buying seems attractive to me as you're coming back to a place that's familiar and can feel like home, or the closest to it. Is it too much hassle? Is it easy to outsource the rental of the place when you're not there?"

All advice is greatly appreciated.,"For context I'm 25(m) and since March I've been teaching English online from Bali. Sounds ideal right? Well kinda, my main problem stems from the gig's inherent unpredictability. Bookings fluctuate and my income is too volatile. 
I've researched a lot of amazing opportunities; copywriting, blogging, web design, digital marketing, affiliate marketing, and the list goes on. The problem I have is knowing what direction to take that will give me a tangible return on investment within a few months of education/self-education. One thing I've already done is started a YouTube channel with my partner and shooting + editing the videos. But I don't expect that to grow into an income for quite awhile. Are there any video editors working freelance or full time that can offer advice for how to improve and get hired?

I am what I can only describe as a slow nomad, staying 2m to a year at a place, working remotely.

At this point in time, we've become a family of 3 (2 parents & baby) and are looking into setting up a home base while we visit various destinations (staying for months at a time).

I can do any combination of these cities and have lived all over the US and worked from many coworking spaces. Also I will be flying in from Europe where I’m a permanent resident (US passport though). 

Post Covid Vaccine/ or 2021-2022. 

I would love a city with coworking spaces and the opportunity to meet other digital nomads particularly programmers working on cool projects. I would love to work with a small team making websites, videos, graphics and tracking the analytics of any product or service they are selling online. I realize that just for visa reasons there may be some hoops to jump through so was curious about the following: 

Which of these cities is best to start in? 
Which is the cheapest? 
Which is the easiest for immigration? 
Which will offer great techno and house music (not commercial remixes)? 
Which has a serious entrepreneurial spirit to it where people are looking to form teams and make real money? 
If I were to do some combination of this and fly in and out for visa renewals what’s the best way to do that?

Ultimately I have narrowed my search down to these places (don’t want any islands) and am curious about where to start. I have also been teaching English to adult Vietnamese students for over 2 years and feel they have a very good work ethic and are not afraid to Google things and learn new stuff. Also really like how the younger people are into Esports and would like to get into that if possible to then maybe meet some younger people to go into business with. I would really like to eventually create a team of internet entrepreneurs (or join one) and at the same time have great amenities in the city. 

So which city is the best for these things? Not fake IG people talking about making money - but people actually doing it! Masterminds, Coworking’s, etc... ps the beach isn’t particularly interesting to me....

I pinged my contact network to see what people recommend for mail forwarding services and got back a few recs for Earth Class Mail. I researched and researched and spoke to them and researched and finally decided this plan would be great. I got a street address in my new city.

Well, I signed up, I'm now in the new city, and from the moment I started changing over addresses I hit issues. USPS: ""We won't forward from your new CMRA (Commercial Mail Receiving Agency) to your next address."" Bank of America: ""You can't use this, it's a CMRA."" I stopped there. I was fuming. I called up my local UPS Store to see about getting a box there (that was my runner-up option) and they assured me, ""no, no problems at all, everyone uses this, it's a street address!"" I pull up the Bank of America site, try to put in the UPS Store- ""You can't use this, it's a CMRA.""

What on Earth do you people do? This must be hell going forward- driver's license renewal, IRS, health insurance perhaps, etc. etc. etc. etc. I have no clue what issues might wait in store for me. What do expats or nomads do when they explicitly do not want to have to deal with a physical address? Obviously for light stuff (catalogs, run-of-the-mill business correspondence, etc.) something like Earth Class would be fine, but...

j665ra,,Anyone else worried about being old and broke?,"&#x200B;

During the first few years of my nomad 'career' I was fortunate enough to make very good money, so I was able to save a lot. In the past 2-3 years though it got more difficult. I had a major accident three years ago and wasn't able to work for months (I'm fully recovered FYI). When I got back to work, what I had been doing didn't work as well anymore so my income went down a lot. 

A few months ago, I decided to go back to corporate life. I didn't apply for jobs, but I was offered an interesting position in my home country (Germany), so I decided to accept it, thinking it's not a bad choice during times of Corona and after travelling a lot these past years. A major motivation also was the fact that I wouldn't have to worry about a steady income anymore and that my employer would take care of things like my health insurance, taxes and retirement fund etc.

Fast forward to now- I'm not really happy with corporate life, at least not under these conditions. I have to be at the office 4 days a week, I work 40+ hours. I'm not happy being stuck here, and I want to go back to freelancing, or doing my own thing so I can choose where I want to be (if Corona allows ofc) and when I work etc. 

I do often have the same worries as before though. I'll be able to work just fine for the next couple years, even decades, but what happens when I'm 60+? I don't think I'll ever be able to make as much money as in the beginning of my nomad career (I was extremely lucky, on top of working hard ofc). So even if I'll be able to live just fine off my savings and my freelancer money for the next years, what happens when I'm old, possibly sick and won't be able to provide for myself anymore? My home country pays good salaries and I'm pretty sure I would make more money in a corporate job than nomading around. But then again, my home country is also more expensive than third world countries and I don't see myself living here doing corporate life forever. I have tried to find a 100% remote job but it's been more than difficult.

Any of you guys have the same fears about being broke when old? Any advice on how to handle those fears, or even how to avoid situations like that in the far future  (without having to make lots of money every month)?

&#x200B;

Thx."

j6iw0a,1ifsteq,Business Idea for Helping Aspiring Digital Nomads,"So I'm pretty new to the digital nomad life, but I feel like I've found a somewhat unique way of doing it. Essentially, a group of friends and I are spending every month at a different Airbnb in a different part of the U.S., as well as a few other countries. The group is great to have because it tends to drive down rent costs (I'm talking <$500/mo each) and makes for a way more fun nomad experience that facilitates some really awesome friendships.

Anyway, with the persistence of COVID, I've had a lot of friends express interest in doing a similar experience with their own group, but they don't really know where to start in terms of looking at Airbnbs, getting a group together, planning the whole thing. As a result, my idea is to have a sort of travel agency that plans these types of trips for groups and takes all the hassle out of the logistics. 

I'm curious if a) y'all have heard of a service already doing this, and b) this is a service that you or people you know might be interested in demoing.

My 2 years in the powerplant was only a contract cadet training experience and it was kind of hell of a job compared to when I was starting to freelance (which is a completely different career compared to when I was working as an electrical engineer). 

However, I have seen the disadvantage of freelancing sadly and the ""it's not stable"" part is affecting me financially. But I think it's really my fault as I loaned for a house and car (5 year old so kinda cheap now) altogether because I may have bought too soon and not that much savings (only like 40% savings if we go for like the estimate total total price of the house and car).

I can imagine now that if I lose my current client, I'd see my savings slowly dwindle and will raise my anxiety again. The part when I lose a client and having to apply to Upwork, Freelancer and Fiverr like crazy every single day is kinda tiring.

What's great about my previous clients is they do give me proof that I have worked from them but it's only like a short document with their logo and the signature of the CEO and that's it. Not sure if that helps if I want to go back to corporate again.  

I have friends that have gone freelance for over 10 years but their resume also looked like someone who has been job hopping their whole life too. My longest client so far is only 2 years and I don't know how long we'll last together since the coronavirus hit their business pretty hard and I might get laid off again.

However I also do have some friends who have been with the same client for 7 or 8 years and it amazes me that they have been with those clients for a long time. Perhaps even the shortest time with their client being only 3 years. It kinda makes me wonder how they did it or if they are just that good at picking clients.

People also told me that even work from home jobs have the ""stable"" option if I wanted to and told me that I could go work from digital marketing agencies or web design agencies.

Now I was wondering that if it would be good idea to go work for these agencies as a full time job and have some freelance on the side.

If I ever do plan to go back in corporate jobs though (let's say engineering related), will it be hard to go back with most of my experience going to web and graphic design?"

j9njjl,tf24i,"What do you think will be the effects of so many large companies going permanently remote, and the potential massive influx of new ""digital nomads"" over the next several years? I forsee some possible serious negative consequences along with the positives.","Lately I've been reading tons of stories about about huge corporations deciding they'll be converting to permanently remote, planning to continue even post-covid. I've seen some crazy estimates that over 1/3 of all businesses could remain either mostly or permanently work-from-home.

Over the last 5-10 years the number of DNs has grown substantially, but its still always been a pretty niche endeavor due to the high barrier to entry of finding suitable remote work. But once the world opens up again post-Covid, there's going to be very little holding people back from becoming location independent.

While its obviously great millions of people are going to be free from the BS that comes with commuting to an office everyday, I wonder about the near-term effects this sudden drastic societal shift could bring.  

Some of the negatives I see...

1. Nomads might flock to and potentially over-run the most popular destinations.  This could have some serious negative impact on some of these places. Prices for short/mid term housing rentals could skyrocket.  Local property owners could convert their long term rentals to short term they can rent to nomads at higher costs...driving rents up for locals (exacerbating the Airbnb effect).

 Not to mention impacts on infrastructure / culture. Some of the most popular destinations for DNs are places that already have been struggling dealing with an influx of tourists. 

2. Tax revenue could disappear very quickly from a lot of places. Cities like San Francisco &amp;amp; NYC are already seeing a mass exodus. People now working remote are rushing to leave expensive cities. Permanent residents in these places could be replaced with temporary nomads who generally aren't paying any local income taxes (further fueling this short-term housing boom)

 Nobody likes paying taxes, but most places depend on it to run. Imagine what would happen if tons of people start shifting their residency to tax haven countries.    In the long term the sudden outflow of income taxes could be replaced with increase in sales taxes / other revenue from nomadic workers...but its going to take some time to adjust. This could mean higher taxes for local residents.

 The shift out of expensive cities could also cause a pretty dramatic decline in the residential real estate markets...which is good thing in the long run, but could cause some economic chaos in short term.

3. Wages may plummet. Its not going to take long before companies converting to fully remote realize they can now open up once localized job positions to the global market. As we see with sites like Upwork, this typically drives wages down. I think a lot of people are going to lose their jobs to outsourced labor. This is going to further drive people out of cities propped up only by their relatively high wages. 

 On the bright side it could also help life wages in places that typically don't attract large corporations.  But what happens to families who need to stay static? Their jobs are going to be driven to places with the lowest costs of living. I'm not sure how this will balance out.

4. Impending commercial real estate crash. A lot of cities rely very heavily on companies maintaining large amounts of office space for their HQs. Some places are going to be hit hard by these companies all downsizing at once. Not to mention a lot of businesses in city centers rely heavily on traffic from commuters. 

 I think in the long term this could lead to commercial property being converted to affordable real estate. But in the short term it could get ugly until cities adapt.

5. Psychological damage ... I honestly don't think the vast majority of people will be happy working remote indefinitely. Right now many people are still in the ""honeymoon phase"" of work-from-home. But I think people are going to start reaching their breaking points (imagine being stuck in a tiny NYC apartment with 3 housemates all trying to WFH).  

 I know a lot of people who give up after a year or so  Maintaining work-life balance, isolation, and lack of work-developed friendships can take a serious toll. But companies could shift to shunning people who want to be in the office since it means more space they'll have to buy.

6. Personal relationships can suffer. It can be extremely taxing to be stuck at home with your SO (or housemates) all day, every day. For parents with young kids it can be near impossible to work.  They need the escape of the office. Hopefully it doesn’t become a situation mentioned in #5 where people are penalized for wanting office space.

There's plenty of positives too. Spending 9-5 in cubicles is soul destroying, people are going to get some of their life back. Its going to cut down on commuting/traffic (good for the mind and the planet). It could bring property values down in cities that are unlivable right now. And both people and businesses save money. Lower commuting costs + lower office overhead.

 In my opinion the ideal scenario for most work places (and society) is a hybrid approach, involving 2-3 days at home / 2-3 days at the office each week. If people want to go full remote for a period of time they can. Companies can start offering full remote time on top of vacation time... allowing employees to take a couple months away to work elsewhere, but still maintaining some semblance of ""home base"". 

Interested to hear others thoughts on this? Do you think the DN tidal wave is coming? Good thing or bad thing?

**edit** Some discussion points people bringing up! to be clear, I dont think most people will full time DN, I do think enough young workers will choose to explore it to make an impact. I also think there’s going to be tons of part time / short duration nomads who could still create many of these effects in other ways."

This is something I am always interested in, and for most of us digital nomads with day jobs, we dont fit into the backpacker or one bagger category.  For example, on every backpacker packing list, you have a small towel, I have never once needed a towel while traveling, but I have never stayed in a hostel.

***For me, I have a few weird ones.*** 

**Extra Passport Photos:** I have had a hell of a time getting a passport photo in a few countries, so now when I get them, I get 8, so I dont have to bother with the process again. 

**Wifi Extender:** Again, all it took was a few bad situations before I added this to my must have's and it has saved me on a few occasions. 

**Laptop Book Case:** This is a dumb one, but in some stupid scenario, I have made up in my head having a laptop case that looks like a book/journal will fool a thief who breaks into my room to steal stuff.

jbeju7,4mwhb,<1kg! Sharing my eye-level 16in second monitor setup at 957g,"Hi DN reddit.  Somewhat new to the sub, please forgive any newbie-ness

## Intro

Will start out by saying that I've been inspired by many of your second monitor setups.  iPads on sidecar/duet, mountie clips, magnetic clamps on your mega-rig clever table stands, using a second roost, trees..., and tripods with tablet clamps

I tried many of those myself, but unfortunately they didn't fit what I was looking for which was 
* Fullsize eye-level monitor 
* Lightweight, packable
* Low risk of damage (didn't want to risk mountie)

## What I tried

I'm not going to go into too much detail here, because I spent way too long on this.  Happy to answer questions below.  But I found that I needed the top of the monitor to be at 19inches, and most solutions were too short – or those that were not were much too heavy.  You can literally spend an entire day looking at tablet stands, laptop stands, easels, gooseneck clamps, tabletop/desktop/vlogger/mini tripods, etc.

I spent a lot of time also going through the subreddit.  The most impressive of which is [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/bjvkda/i_figured_id_share_my_rig_its_been_almost_perfect/) (but clamps won't work well with roost) and also found [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/gvx3l1/found_a_portable_setup_for_mbp_ipad_as_secondary/) trying something similar (tripod too short for me)

## What worked

Ended up figuring out that smaller desktop/vlogger tripods would be best for height.  Also included some well-built selfie sticks.  Found that for attaching it, a magnet solution seemed to be the best for anything larger than ~iPad mini size.

# [Here is my setup](https://imgur.com/xYHjtnM)

**Weighs 956.9g (obvi ignore macbook and roost stand)**

* A [rubber-coated magnet](https://imgur.com/G2hlIQR) I pulled from [here](https://www.amazon.com/Livestream-Gear-Magnetic-Metallic-Devices/dp/B06ZZ24HFM/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=livestream+magnet&qid=1602723230&sr=8-6).  Not sure why picture doesn't match item..
    - They have [less-featured bundles](https://www.amazon.com/Livestream-Gear-Universal-Magnetic-Metallic/dp/B06ZZBJFV4/ref=sr_1_18?dchild=1&keywords=livestream+magnet&qid=1602723690&sr=8-18) also.  I just happen to have bought a bigger bundle in my exploration
* A metal plate on the back of the screen from [these guys](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DKEXMVG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).  
    - Picked these just to be safe, metal little thicker

**Cost: $170 for screen.  $60 for stand pieces.**

**Weight: 956.9g total!**  ~700g for the screen.  ~200g for stand bits.  ~50g for the cable.  (Screen has a matching included cover that's 265g if you want to carry that, but not needed esp if you have a laptop sleeve)

**Quick Q&A:**

* Is it sturdy?  Surprisingly [yes](https://imgur.com/47ktLwR) and mostly [yes](https://imgur.com/Z0SFUqb).  If your table is getting 'quaked/bumped a lot, consider some other options I put below
* Does it fold down neatly?  [Yes](https://imgur.com/91bi3ep).
* Why that screen?  Zenscreen has solid reputation, and this one was lighter than others in their lineup
* Do you carry anything else?  You'll need a proper usb-c cable, but you may already be carrying one.  Also I may carry the protective 

## Closing

I'm quite happy with this setup.  I spent [MANY](https://imgur.com/J8QlZnM), [many](https://imgur.com/wZGzDPq), [many](https://imgur.com/wFMWcF1), [many](https://imgur.com/8SudNIs), [many](https://imgur.com/QU3SFpy), and many unpictured attempts with different solutions, measuring and weighing.  Based on the time I spent, I think this is my end goal for now.  That being said, what would make me even more happy would be if someone found an even better setup! 

## Additional notes

*Pro-tips if you want to do your own research*.  A lot of the telescoping tripods don't lock vertically and will slide down.  This limits you on a lot of tripods in this size category.  Also if you're thinking about the bigger Joby telescoping tripod.. the legs are weaker and didn't support as much weight.

*What if I want a stronger hold/magnet?*. The rubber magnet link actually is part of a 2-pack that can be combined.  So just use both.  Also concern for strength the reason I bought metal plates separately because they were thicker.  But personally, I think the magnet/plate strength is a great match for the monitor 

*What else can I use the tripod for?*. Use it with your phone.  I have a magnet in the back of mine and use it was a selfie stick as it's intended.  Note you might have mobility issues.

*Can I use the magnet for other things?*. Sure I guess.  I looked into getting a suction mount so I could attach magnet to it + my phone and mount car dashboards and other places.  But I ended up finding a great trick for using a rubber band and air vents to mount my phone there.  And didn't think the added weight for a suction cup tripod combo was worth it.

*For those looking for a sturdier tripod*.  This setup was plenty for my needs.  But if you're not as worried about the weight and want a sturdier tripod, let me recommend a few.  Oben [TT-200](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/687342-REG/Oben_TT_200_TT_200_Table_Top_Tripod.html) and [TT-300](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/687343-REG/Oben_TT_300_TT_300_Table_Top_Tripod.html) - strong, sturdy, heavy.  TT-200 is a little short for my 19inch eye-level though.  [Fotofans tripod](https://www.ebay.com/itm/FOTOFANS-Tripod-Desktop-Mini-Mobile-Phone-Stand-for-Micro-SLR-Camera-1-4-PTZ/274460814524?hash=item3fe723acbc:g:adsAAOSwHnhfODJz) - This one was my second choice actually because of how it folded down.  Note that it's frustrating to use, but it does feel sturdier than mine.  Also worth noting fotofans is very similar to the [lumecube tripod](https://lumecube.com/products/telepod-streamer-stand-and-tripod), and I actually tried that one out myself too (but note, it doesn't lock vertically if you're curious).

*For iPad users*.  I actually also tried getting an iPad 12.9 for this, but found it to be too small for me.  But if that works for you, know that even the 12.9 iPad pro worked well with this setup.  I liked that setup a lot, because it was easy to mount/unmount the iPad when I wanted to use my apple pencil with it.  I think in the future, I might actually pick up a smaller iPad and use it as a 3rd monitor and replace my kindle too.  Or am I going to crazy here..

I got a degree in psychology abroad, mainly because I wanted to be abroad, and I loved it, and I know that I want a career that allows me to travel full time. I just don't know what I could do.


I suffer from intense fatigue, so being a flight attendant or other high energy level jobs (especially working with customers) isn't a good fit.

Are there non-clinical work in psychology that could allow me to travel? Are there other not-high-tech work I can do that can be a full on career? 


Toss out any ideas you might have that are realistic, or point me in the right direction for where I can look/ask.

It began with our bank: they would not accept my ECM address as the physical address and so I just used the temporary one where I am now staying but was able to use the ECM one for our mailing. I was hoping that would be the end of it, wincing a bit at what might happen with things like health insurance, etc. Well from what I read the IRS/tax returns aren’t an issue and the health insurance companies seemed to have accepted it without issue. So I thought I was in the clear!

But I just had to update our address with Apple who uses the firm Dun and Bradstreet to verify business info. They are now asking me for things like a lease, license, things like that. I don’t know what to do. I just changed over everything to our ECM address, filed tax returns, the works.

I would hate to have to cancel and redo everything (who knows what that might entail?) switching to  something like virtualpostmail (EDIT- their reviews suck. Great.) I want to just keep ECM and move forward. Do you have any advice as to what I should do and/or what sort of documents I might be able to provide Dun and Bradstreet to be done with all this?

I'm in my early thirties so I thought okay, maybe it's time to settle somewhere and be closer to family. My family has been guilt tripping me basically all these years, saying that's it's time for me to settle down, that I need to grow up, that I can't be doing this forever and that one day they won't be around anymore. I guess all of this finally worked on me and I moved back home, to a big (European) city close to my parents. I even signed a lease, bought furniture. I thought mabe Covid is a sign that I should finally settle. And it gets even worse: I accepted a full-time job, because my Mom basically begged me to give it a try, and because they pay well.

I've been living here for five months now and while initially it was nice to decorate my own (rental)apartment and to see my family more, I feel like I'm wasting my life here. I've made some new friends, have been to plenty of events etc, so it's not that. It's that I miss everything about being a nomad and working for myself. I miss meeting likeminded people. While I have met nice people here, nobody can really relate to the lifestyle that I had. I miss working for myself and being able to decide what time to start working and what time to finish. I miss being able to work from home, from an coworking, a cafe and from wherever I want to. I miss living in a hot place during European winter, being able to decide wherever I wanna go and for how long. I miss adventure.

I booked a one way ticket to Mexico a few days ago. I'm leaving a week from now. I'm taking two weeks off work (I haven't had a single day off since I started working there). It's basically a vacation, but I think it will be more than that. I think I'll be loving it so much that I will want to stay (been there before and now I have a few nomad friends living there). I haven't even left for Mexico yet, and I'm already dreading leaving Mexico and coming back to my normal, boring routine here. Especially since Europe has been getting worse and worse with Covid lately and we might face another big lockdown soon. I'd be happy to keep working for my company for a while IF they allowed me to do it from Mexico, but I don't think they would. 

So there goes my dilemma- Possibly stay in Mexico, quitting my job and disappointing my family - Or going back home after two weeks in Mexico, to European winter, facing another lockdown, with this awful feeling that nothing ever happens and that I'm wasting my precious time and life. For now it's not about money, btw. I would be able to quit my job and go back to freelancing. Long term who knows.

What should I do? What would you do?"

\- Setting realistic expectations re. experiencing the place *vs* managing work load

\- Checking in with myself on stressors, what's coming up for me and going over some of my own worksheets I give to clients *(I'm actually totally happy to share a worksheet I have for this, but not sure I can upload an attachment for this here? New to Reddit)*

jiuj89,kcy2p,Advice on working a US remote job from Mexico,"I just started a fully remote internship at a large company. There is no expectation for me to report to the physical office in the foreseeable future, and most likely for the duration of the 6 month internship.

In December, I want to work remotely from Mexico (I'm looking at Cabo San Lucas) for about 2-3 weeks. My plan would be to find an AirBnb with great wifi that can accommodate a work from home set up. 

I'm wondering how and if I should tell my manager about this idea when I meet with them to go over general goals/expectations for my internship this week. 

I'm worried they might object to it because of possible issues with having a worker based temporarily out of the state/country and how that might affect their tax reporting. Or maybe raise concerns about cybersecurity/IT and logging into the company VPN from out of the country.

Part of me just doesn't want to bring it up because its easy to say no to an intern with little experience/value to the company. I'm confident that day-to-day my manager and team I'm working with would not notice my working from Mexico, and I can keep the same level of productivity.

If I do bring it up, maybe I say it in a vague way like ""Is it ok for me to not work from my typical home office for a couple weeks? Providing good wifi and a good work set up."" If they say yes I can take that as liberty to work from anywhere. 

Some relevant info: I'm living at my parents house and work from here, my address is registered here at my parents house. My parents house is in the same city as the company I work for. I have a company issued laptop that I use for work and theres a company VPN to log onto.

Our plan to rent a place in Ubud for a year, and enjoy Bali while working on our online businesses (not local work).

As I've seen quite a bit of conflicting info, really like to better identify the tax and visa situation.

Here's what I gathered so far (feel free to tell me I'm wrong):

1. a US citizen must still file for taxes
2. if eligible for such, an FEIE can waive \~105k (this however would not cover 15% for social security and medicare)
3. one can apply for a tourist visa for a month (extend for an additional month), and do so continually
4. Social visas can also be obtained (these are good for 6 months)
5. only a business visa allows one to work while in Bali

So here's where I get lost: if we go to Bali, and do what most say and get a tourist visa, and then work remotely (via US blog and freelancing), we'd technically be working illegally?

a) If so, what is the recommended approach here?

b) How would local taxes work out?"

jjnc8y,17vyp4ch,Freelance remote job for tech savvy and customer oriented individuals,"After a long year with a minimum wage job I finally have what continues to prove to be a dream job at a growing startup. I sent countless job applications working towards going remote and have officially made it as a digital nomad.

I have an opportunity that I’d like to broadcast to this group for those aspiring nomads that need that first remote gig to start them off in an attempt to share the wealth. 

The position is as a customer support position in a 3D virtual event venue space. We do events with organizers from all over the world and the job is all about greeting new users, on boarding them, doing some basic trouble shooting , and generally being attentive. It is not a difficult job, but there is a learning curve that is easy enough if you are tech savvy in the slightest. It requires a bit of patience at times however.

This is a freelance position in a new team that is starting from the ground up, all work and billing going through UpWork. The events/shifts can be as little as 4 hours and up to 12 hours and you get to pick which events you work. Pay is something like $18 per hour after the UpWork fees and because you are working through UpWork you can work from anywhere despite the company being based in the USA. Planned growth opportunities are limited, so there isn’t much room for growth besides a bump in pay after a certain amount of time, but historically, folks at this company graduate to other roles if they show talent that can transfer over elsewhere (a buddy that started in this role some months ago just got a salaried full time remote position in IT so it’s possible if you play your cards right). 

English is required, other languages are highly sought after. You need your own computer to use the software and it needs some halfway decent specs (8gigs ram, 1.8 GHz Core i5).

First time DN here. Apparently many country can and will close down without a moments notice, therefore a reminder to check your destination daily and book only refundable tickets.

Looks like very few places accept Canadians now in EU, I think Switzerland accepts Canadians until Nov 3 so it might be possible to reroute flights if you have a connection in EU, but you'll still face a 10 day quarantine.

jlp5xq,8pad06rr,Struggling with the ethics of a nomadic lifestyle during the Coronavirus. Your thoughts?,"Come March I will have to move out of my home in NYC (this is happening regardless of what I do). My plan prior to the pandemic was always to try a nomadic lifestyle. Obviously the pandemic has complicated that.

My plan tentatively is to join a close friend in Hawaii come March and stay for 2 months (maybe 1). After that, I'd like to join a friend in Mexico City and live there for 6 months. From there, I'll figure out what's next. I am staying in these places for those durations as it aligns with when I'll have a friend/place to stay with. 

I am immensely conflicted. I have been extremely vigilant about the coronavirus. I have not eaten out once. I have only met 1 or 2 friends outside socially distanced with masks at any given time. I have definitely not gone to any parties. Not out of concern for personal safety but because I feel it's a duty we all bear to sacrifice for the greater good. 

This is my inherent conflict. Is it ethically right or justifiable to embark on this more nomadic lifestyle where I expect to stay at a place 3-6 months and move on? 

On one hand, I justify it to myself by saying I will only *move* to a location. I won't engage in reckless or selfish behavior. I will be the best visitor I can be until a vaccine. Many people have moved since the pandemic and I would be one of them. I don't fault them for making a move and find it rather reasonable. Moreover, we may have a vaccine by the time my 6 month stint in Mexico is over. Which would mitigate any concerns on my end of my next few moves.

On the other, nomadic lifestyles are inherently different. While I will practice all precaution while I am settled/living in a place, I aim to be moving around every 3-6 months with the exception of the initial 1-2 month stint in Hawaii. There's no guarantee that there will be a vaccine and that sort of frequent movement is not helpful. And if I ever do get sick, I could be a disproportionate burden to a country like Mexico that is less equipped financially to deal with a pandemic.

Would love your thoughts on the situation. Excuse me if I post this on a few other subreddits. Would like to consider the widest variety of viewpoints I can. Thank you for reading.

No one is really travelling at the moment but if you consider in the near future working somewhere different. I would like to recommend Japan.

While a good option is to get a job in Japan, this might not be for you. Japan also has 1 year work-holiday agreement with many countries. So you can keep your job and live in Japan for a year.

If after a year you want to continue you either need to get

A) A Specialists visa

B) A visa related to your field sponsored by company

C) Spouse Visa

After 3-10 years on this VISA you can apply for Permanent residency and stay for as long as you want.

jqag0g,7dqbubj3,Unrealistic expectations?,"So, I actually started computer science in college specifically for becoming a digital nomad, or at least to be independent on a specific workplace. I am currently at the end of the journey, and have had a couple of jobs a long the way, and I am soon to realize this whole thing. I am debt-free, single and I don't have any expensive physical possessions (no car etc).

I was wondering whether my expectations for this exciting and anxiety provoking journey might be over the top?

First off. I am ""kinda"" unhappy about my current situation. As everyone knows there is good and bad times, but generally I just tend to think my current situation is all temporary. I keep on thinking about my future, and that all I do now is merely to get somewhere else.

The thing is I have always had toxic relationships which I have always felt held me back in some way. (A lot of drinking, promoting bad and careless behaviour etc). And I have always thought that I had too many friends for my own good. (I am an introvert by nature, with a previously inhibitory social anxiety, now just annoying). And I truly believe that the lack of stress from having to keep up with everyone will be soothing.

I have always wanted to spend more time on myself. And I have this feeling that by relocating to somewhere else, I might have an easier time getting rid of old habits and maybe reinventing myself in some way? Not that it would have to happen by itself, but I have this feeling that if I put in the time and effort that I might change for the better.  However - as comforting as the thought is. I tend to think it is a trap of some sort? To think that the place will give you the remedies or circumstances for changing yourself might be a bit ignorant.

I would think my situation is recognized by many, the idea of becoming a digital nomad would provide circumstances for you to improve yourself.

So my question is: Does any of you have had these feelings or expectations, and do you think you realized them and what happened?"

jqjkeg,owkd8,We're building a platform focused on remote work. Honest feedback we're trying to help solve problems in remote work. - Remotely," 

Hey guys,

For the last year or so my team and I have been working remotely and we've been trying to build tools to help solve for remote work and the problems surrounding it. We started with a daily meeting place where you have a team planet that you can hang out on. That went well but didn't nail all the problems we were hoping to.

We made another product [https://meetings.remotelyhq.com/](https://meetings.remotelyhq.com/) focused on helping engage a team during a meeting and relieve zoom fatigue which is just one small portion of the greater remote working problems. It's focused on providing a game like atmosphere to make meetings more enjoyable for everyone.

Right now we're really looking for assistance in solving the above meeting problem (then the whole remote problem space) and if you're interested in giving some feedback and letting us know what you think please do. Not pushing anything on anyone, if it's not for you totally cool, we're just hoping to find people it does help solve a real problem for.

We have a discord here: [https://discord.gg/sfBbMArpUd](https://discord.gg/sfBbMArpUd)"

For instance, the barista at the coffee shop, or the owner of that other store. We are all ""friends"" but it's in their interest to continue being nice to me because I frequent their shops. So i feel like after all these months i don't really have any real friends who i don't pay for? 

I don't generally have a problem talking to people and making friendly conversation whenever I move to a new town. But where do I find people to be my friends who I don't pay for?"
jqnp5f,pa5er,"Looking to travel the US while working, looking for sleeping/working arrangement suggestions.","Hi all, I've been lurking around here for a while but decided to ask a few questions while I plan my traveling next year. I'll start by giving some details.

I'm a motion designer that works totally remote. Macbook pro, mouse and keyboard with hopefully a second monitor. Internet needs to be available for 9 hours out of the day at least. Doesn't have to be super fast, mostly for video calls and uploading/downloading 5mg-200mb videos. I'm planning on using my phone most of the time unless I stay somewhere that has internet available. I may purchase a hotspot too for a backup.

I'm hoping to travel around the US and stay in a bunch of different places for 1 week to 1 to 2 months at a time. Maybe do that for a year? Maybe longer? I'm not sure at this point. I drive a VW Golf so not a lot of space and its suggested you don't tow.

First question is sleeping and working arrangements.  I'm deciding between AirBNBs, camping, selling my car for something bigger/can tow or a combo of all of them. I'd hate to sell my car since I just got it a year ago and I love it but if it comes to that it might be a good choice.

A lot of the other stuff I'm pretty good with. Insurance, banking, is all good. Mail I'll have to figure out but...sleeping arrangement is my biggest hurdle.

Thanks!"

jr15dx,25vckrqc,I'm planning to negotiate traveling internationally with my employer this week. Any tips?,"Hello All--

I work 100% remote as a Mental Health Clinician in Michigan. I’ve been with my company for two years with the intention to eventually live the Digital Nomad lifestyle and travel internationally while doing my job. 

I’ve officially gotten to the point where I want to negotiate with my boss to let me travel internationally while working remotely, but I need some help preparing. Here are some particulars of my job:

\-I am a mental health professional, so there are a lot of legal implications regarding traveling while doing mental health work. I’ve already discussed with the National Social Work board about traveling, and they said legally there is no reason why I cannot travel and do Mental Health work, however, it has rarely been done before (They said I was the first person to ever ask), so most Mental Health agencies are hesitant to do it because often there is a lot of red tape.

\-Also, I have realllllly high security when it comes to my job, so I use a VPN for my company, as well as multiple VPN’s for the various hospitals I work for for the Electronic Health Records I use, so I am wondering if I would run into any technological issues of not being able to access records?

\-Simply leaving without telling my company isn’t an option. They are the largest Mental Health Company in my state, so if I were to risk getting fired, I would basically commit career suicide because they offer 60% of mental health jobs in my area, and the other 40% of jobs would most likely not hire me if they saw I was fired by them

\-I am 100% remote and I have never had to go into my office in person. I work in a tiny program with one other employee, one supervisor, and two administrative staff, and I haven’t had a video chat with any of my co-workers or my supervisor for over three months, so them noticing where I am located isn’t an issue. 

\-I am mainly interested in going to Mexico in the Quintana Roo area, Sayulita area, or to Costa Rica. Video conferencing is the main function of my job (I do assessments with patients in the ER), so I have to have a good wifi connection. Any advice on how the connection would be in these areas or tips for how to improve it?

Finally and most importantly, how do I best approach this conversation? My former boss (she was laid off due to COVID, I’ve never met my current boss), told me I could travel anywhere in the USA while working, so I thought I could play off of this and mention that due to some personal lifestyle changes, It’s important to me that I can be location independent, and that I’d like to check in that I’m still able to travel in the USA, and also internationally. 

What are some questions I should be prepared to answer from my boss? What information should I have with me so I can help negotiate? How would you go about this conversation/what’s worked with you when negotiating with employers in the past?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I am negotiating with my boss to let me travel internationally at my remote mental health job, what is some advice to help this conversation go well?"

jru208,143qs2,"I flew to Sayulita, Mexico with Minaal 3.0 Carry-on, Daily and accessories. Here's my review.","The combo is great for digital nomads as is so easy to change from traveling mode to coffee shop. So I flew to Sayulita, Mexico from the US. I moved around different apartments using constantly both of the backpacks. I can finally share my review, and explain you how I use it:

[Here's my video that explains it better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B9gnx5Z8q4)

If you prefer written, let's start with the overall thoughts:

* The combo is great for digital nomads as is so easy to change from travelling mode to coffee shop mode
* Design wise, both look awesome —between professional and stylish
* The new (Picton) fabric is really nice, the dust (and sand as I'm on the beach) goes away very easily so it stays clean all the time
* If you liked the minaal 2.0, there are not many differences
* Both have the same raincover, it's nice to have just in case

**Carry-on:**

* It's spacious enough but might small for some people (especially coming from the PK design backpack)
* It's easy to open when fully loaded, but better use pouches for everything if you want smooth opening/closing
* I love the weight is handled with the shoulder straps lever
* The water bottle holder is great but when it's fully loaded is a bit hard to put it in
* Double upper compartment is great! i use one for the toiletry kit if in the airport is needed to take out
* It's maximum size keeps me sure that any airport will accept this bag as a carry-on
* The only downside I'm having so far, is that with a very loaded backpack, the straps aren't comfortable but not sure if it is because I'm not adjusting it that well.

**Hip pads:**

* Small add-on for the carry-on that I believe it's worth it.
* You can still hide them along the shoulder straps

**Daily:**

* It's my favorite daily bag of all time (I tried a few like AER go)
* Love how compact it is when compressed down and opens wide to put my stuff in pouches fast and easy
* I take this bag everywhere: coffee shop, hiking, beach, gym
* Downsides will be that water bottle holder is a bit small, and for heavy loads it gets a bit uncomfortable

**Packing cubes:**

* They are great, tho I believe are the same 2.0 version
* Don't compress, simple but designed to fit both carry-on or daily

**Toolcase:**

* Got the small one as i'm forcing myself to travel with less, but love the size especially if we compared to the PK tech pouch
* The separators are nice, but I took them out to dump everything inside
* Mesh area is nice for the small accesories

**Shirt protector:**

* I'm using the first version but works very well to avoid wrinkles
* Love how easy to accomodate on the carry-on bag

\---

So overall I'm very happy with the combo. I used to have the PK Design Travel Backpack and while it was more spacious, it was heavier and  I just like that Minaal forces to be more minimal. I'm very happy with the aesthetic of both bags. And how I can easily take out the Daily, put my digital nomad office kit on it and ready to check any place.

Let me know if you have any questions about the bags!"

* **Taiwan**: some time ago there was a topic here about the **Gold Card**, an option not too expensive or too complicated if you fit in into specific categories. Did anyone use this?
* **Bali**: apparently there are some plans to allow tourists in December, and I read some discussions about a possible long-term Visa, but couldn't find any reliable source.
* **Malaysia**: there's a **Medical Visa** for a few countries, nothing really useful.
* **Vietnam**, **Japan**, **Singapore**, and others seem to be planning to open for a few Asian countries that have the pandemic under control. Still not very useful for Americans/Europeans.

I'm planning to travel trough Asia mid-next year again, but want to stay for a few months this time. I aspire to do this in one-bag travel, but as I am working as a designer representing a fashion brand and visiting multiple suppliers, factories and business partners on the way I'd at least have to bring one suit and a range of outfits. This is my packing list I am currently planning:

**Peak Design 45L Travel Bag**

Clothing (in PD Medium & Small Packing Cubes)

\- Ministry of Supply Suit Jacket (thinking of dark Grey or Black)

\- Ministry of Supply Suit Pants

\- One pair of Chinos

\- One short for workout

\- One swim short

\- One black button-down shirt

\- One white button-down shirt

\- One casual workers shirt

\- One kashmir turtleneck sweater

\- 4 to 5 t shirts

\- 4 to 5 underwear shorts

\- 2 pair of long socks

\- 3 pair of short socks

\- One pair of Dress Shoes / Chelseas (they take up soo\~ much space....)

\- One pair of White Sneakers (all outfits are black, so I really dig the contrast)

\- One pair of Black Shoes (to travel, walk and hike)

&#x200B;

**Tech**

\- 1x Old Macbook Pro from 2014

\- 1x iPhone

\- 1x Apple Watch

\- 1x Macbook Charging Cable

**-** 1x Anker powerbank

\- 1x Back-up external Hard Drive

\- 1x Micro Micro USB loading cable

\- 1x Apple Watch charging cable

\- 1x Travel Adapter

&#x200B;

**Washing stuff**

**-** Toothbrush

\- Nailclipper

\- Tweezer

\- Electric Shaver

\- Tooth Paste

\- Soap Boar

\- Parfume

\- Gel

\- Comb

\- Small Flask with washing detergent

&#x200B;

**Misc**

\- Microfiver Towel

**-** Joby GripTight One (small tripod because I plan to do some videos from production with my iPhone)

\- Scrubba Bag

\- Passport and stuff

&#x200B;

I haven't bought most of the clothing yet and only used placeholders, but all of this (and considering the outfit I wear) everything fits in 35L. But it's very crammped, and I imagine traveling with such a full bag is a hussle on a daily basis. But I really don't know what to cut here.. maybe some ideas?

Really hate how bulky the dress shoes or chelseas are in the bag, but apparently there are no packable dress shoes in the market at the moment, and I wouldn't dare to combine Sneakers with a suit to formal meetings. The white sneakers are a bit too much luxury to my taste, but I **really** like white Sneakers with black outfits, and they don't take up that much space in the bag.

Maybe you folks have some input? Would really appreciate!!

jtepki,12v86w,Do you have a backup phone?,"For the longest time I traveled with just one phone, but then when I got a new one I thought, you know what?

Now my old phone just kicked the bucket and won't turn on anymore, thus I'm back to one phone.

I was wondering how many of you have a backup phone and what you do if your backup phone ceases to be a backup. Do you get a new good one and retire your current ""new phone"" to ""old phone""? Do you get a new cheap one that serves as a backup from the day you receive it? Or do you simply not have a backup anymore until you get a new one at some point in the future?"

My girlfriend and I plan to move once the pandemic is over, for about 3 months, and hopefully longer.

I have done my research and I've come up with the 5 places above (feel free to recommend other European cities within my criteria). 

We are looking for a walkable city, with cafes, nightlife, safe, clean all for as cheap as possible overall. All 5 seem to meet all of our wishes... It's just tough deciding between them now. 

Here's my thinking so far:

Tbilisi: not the biggest, brightest city, but the best city for its insane value - we were settled on this until we became a bit wary of Georgia's relationship with Russia. The potential risk has pushed us away, but we still consider it. 

Estonia: has a great visa situation, seems promising for people in tech industry, but city seems a bit dull and pricey

Sofia, Bucharest and Budapest seem similar overall...it would come down to the lifestyle and culture (more specifically... A big city, safe, cafe-night life culture).

I've seen reddit posts comparing a couple of cities, but I thought I'd try to group together these 5 to get a more clear idea on what we are looking for. Thanks!

For me, it is very essential to have a large screen to work and study. I cannot do my life without it. Nevertheless, I don't see this topic coming up in many discussions between Digital Nomads. Is it normal for the majority of you to also carry the equipment you need around. Or is it that the people who need it usually find Coworking spaces which provide the material?

I’m a digital nomad, I make good money working for an American company, they used to pay me into my American bank account but I’ve recently moved salary payments to my UK Revolut account. I’m from the UK but haven’t lived there in 15 years. I don’t have any ties to America but I used to live there a few years ago and still have an American bank account. Currently I’m living in a Thailand on a spouse Visa and no one knows I’m working so I’m not paying any tax and technically I shouldn’t really be working here on a spouse visa but it’s a bit of a grey area because there’s no real way to prove anything. I’m actually more concerned about the British government chasing me for tax after enough salary payments land in my uk account.

It seems that starting a company in Panama and declaring Panama as my fiscal residence is the best option. If the British government come after me I can then just show them my Panamanian residence card and since Panama doesn’t tax earnings made outside the country I don’t need to pay tax and it’s legal.

&#x200B;

I work in CS for an European company. The position is entirely remote atm, although they have plans to open an office in the future (postponed due to Covid). The team is split between two european countries (scandinavia and southern europe, CS being mainly on the latter) so it's not centralized in one place.

I have already arranged to go to my home country in latin america for two months, to be able to visit my family since some things are going on. I'm afraid to tell the company, since they have always been inquisitive about where I live and are quite fond of the idea of opening the office.

My concern is mostly not being able to do my job correctly, due to connectivity issues, and the possibility of being caught, although I think I could get away with it since I have real reasons to spend the period abroad.

**We use a site call Dixa as our platform, which uses a VoIP system for phone calls. I am not too savvy about this, so I am not sure if connecting from overseas will affect the performance significantly.**

**I am also concerned about the downgrade on the internet connection I will have, from 500mb fiber to 50mb fiber as well, but I believe it shouldn't be a major issue if always connected via ethernet and being the only one using the connection.**

I thought about using a VPN such as nordvpn or Expressvpn, but I reckon it would slow my already poor connection down to an unusable level, at least for this purposes.

A lot of countries' borders are closed making the ""choice"" easier but I am feeling like I cannot settle anywhere. I spent 3 months of this year in Mexico, but does anyone else feel paralyzed by the number of choices we have to settle in, both domestically and internationally? 

One moment I want to pick a city in the states, commit to a 12-month lease, buy furniture, have a car; you know the whole Young Professional Starter Pack. Another part of me wants to continue to hop around for a few weeks at a time, and just keep moving around with my dog. I am at a loss. I never considered myself an indecisive person, but nowadays it feels like I change my mind every day. 

I also know that when Europe opens up to US tourism, I'll definitely want to go. I know no one can make this decision for me, but has anyone else in the r/digitalnomad community been in a similar scenario?"
jye6pg,9mi21,"[EU] Aiming to become sort of nomads, but getting crazy about it tax wise","So me and my partner are both from Spain, but have been living in the UK since 4 years ago. Both self-employed in the UK atm. We are planning to start moving now, first around EU, trying new places as we feel like it (first trying a month, but longer as we feel, and maybe even more than 6 months depending how it goes).

I am just beginning (1st year) as a self-employed (£20-30k) while my partner is ahead on £45k but this year is rapidly increasing towards £60-80k. We deliver services/digital products.

We haven't yet decided our next location, but to do it, we first need to sort out how the hell are going to simplify and maximize our finances as much as possible in terms of tax as we move around.

Enough story, sorry.

Options already considered and investigated lightly are:

1. Self employed on each country we step on: sucks a lot. I'm good with accounting and numbers, but **having to learn each system of each country is way too annoying**. Although I don't really trust accountants, as my own Excel is way better to what they do. I currently do my own tax returns as they are simple.
2. Setting up a company in a fixed country (Estonia being considered due to not needing to be there, but the location is not the issue here) and getting a good accounting there. This looked like a good option. Fiscally it's beneficial in the case of Estonia.HOWEVER, going deeper on this option I realized we would still need to pay ourselves, either with
   1. Dividends: taxed on origin, i.e. Estonia. Not all can be paid on dividends AFAIK.
   2. Salary: wherever we are located. But then our company NEEDS to be registered in that country so they pay for our social security and also taxes.
   3. Invoicing our company: which requires us registering as self-employed in the country we are one, which brings us back to option 1 and solves nothing. Would only mean double accounting (2 countries), and saving only on the money we keep in the company.

Becoming an actual digital nomad and being tax resident nowhere becomes an option here. If I'm not wrong, we could keep max money in the account as much as possible, and whenever we want to take it out, we need to plan ahead and do 2 steps of under-6-month from country to country, so we become ""free"" fiscally-wise. Then we transfer the lumps out (although I'm not sure where as our banks will be placed somewhere). Maybe this doesn't work and I'm actually missing something. Anyway, not what I'm looking at here, so let's forget it.

(Have looked into consulting sessions of 200-500€ but I'm not willing to pay that without knowing I will get out with a proper solution, and I know it's not possible in an hour with the amount of questions I have).

TL;DR: So the actual reason of this post is to ask for advice and directions of people who are doing these sort of movements (the key here is that these movements might be from under 6 months sometimes, but sometimes going over 6 months). How are you doing it so it doesn't drive crazy your finances? What might be an easy worry-free way if there is one?Again, I do not sleep well rested by getting an accountant and forgetting about everything. I am very obtuse and NEED to understand what are we doing, making sure it's fine, and understanding it. 

I really wish to find a way with all this as we are stuck here delaying our decisions knowing this is the blockade. :( Any help is appreciated. Thank you VERY MUCH in advance!"

jyrgn9,jhtxp,How I set up a digital marketing agency to $300k in 18 months and became location independent without any professional experience," Just thought I'd share my journey a little with everyone on how I became location independent within 12 months.

In May 2019, I packed up my bags with the plan to go travelling for two years. After working in hotel management for over a decade, I built some excellent relationships, when a contact of mine found out and he wanted me to jump on board his consulting agency on a retainer and help him with servicing his clients.

At this same time, a high school friend of mine who had an accounting firm was interested in having me on board with helping with SEO and marketing strategy (I had zero SEO experience at this time) and was happy to pay me a cheap rate in return for learning on his dime. 

I travelled right up until COVID hit before deciding to come back home to Australia as borders began to shut. But during this period, I became incredibly good at SEO and more broadly, brand strategy. I spent a lot of down-time learning and applying best practice for SEO, copywriting, social media marketing and email marketing.

While quarantining and deciding whether I should return to the hotel industry, I decided to give Upwork a shot, and within a week, I picked up two clients who saw the value in what I provided.

Fast forward to now and I'm running a 4-man consulting and marketing agency focused on SEO, copywriting and video marketing that can be totally location independent if it wanted to be. We're turning over close to $300k AUD in just under 10 months. 

Why am I telling you this? It's because I had zero professional or technical experience before achieving what I'm doing now. Instead, there are some key things I attribute to my success:

1. I was a voracious learner - partly because I loved the fact I could apply what I learnt and partly because that's just in my nature
2. I was getting these opportunities because I was putting myself out there. A lot of freelancers/business owners think that they just have to wait for the leads to slowly come to them without doing any networking or putting their name out there. People predominantly do business with people they like
3. I was willing to invest in myself. This meant paying for courses, memberships and coaching just to up my skill level
4. I had no technical skills. I can't code to save my life. I just honed in on my writing skills, learnt a tonne on how others did it and then tested/applied it to my own situation and stubbornly kept at it until I saw traction
5. I got rid of any excuses I could find that would stop me from doing this. Sometimes I think I was just lucky, but you can generate more luck by being in the right place at the right time. Giving up easily means that you also flush away the majority of your luck. I can't tell you how many clients I've picked up because I simply stuck it out and stayed active in business development until I found one that was willing to give me a crack

While the current 1 to 1 model is great money, it's difficult to scale. The next stage of focus is to look into productising all the knowledge I've accumulated into playbooks and frameworks as a one to many model, and shift from a marketing agency to a coaching/membership model helping people learn SEO, find their own clients and become location independent.

Happy to share more insights if it interests anyone and hopefully this provides some value to the community. Particularly those who are looking to become location independent!"

Can anyone here speak from experience on this?  I seem to remember that some passengers on the BA flight from London to Ibiza brought on carry on bags that appeared to be noticably larger than 22x14x9 but I don't remember for sure.

I know the weather can be cold, and I've read that the people can, too.

But the country looks beautiful, the young people speak English, and the cost of living is low.

Anybody who has spent some time in Bulgaria, please let me know what you think of the place.

k0vivo,13g11r,Finding an Apartment When Your Job Involves Speaking/Presenting,"I do some consulting and my work often requires me to be speaking and giving presentations through Zoom calls. This can be a challenge when renting apartments as I often need to speak loudly and in the morning or at night. 

For those of you who are in a similar situation (ex. teachers, customer support, sales etc), do you have any tips to share when you search for a place to stay in cities? How do you avoid disturbing your neighbors with the paper-thin walls of many DN locations? For reference, I'm typically in mid-large cities in South America.

I often book an AirBnb for a month or two at a time in to ensure stability. I have a great app on my laptop that blocks out external noise, I use a headset and portable light to ensure a good audio/visual presentation and I usually buy a local SIM card with 10+ GB of data in case my internet drops out. The loudness of my speaking is the one thing that can be a problem."
k0wg27,3g3f3u2a,Careers To Choose To Become Rich?,"Hi,

I'm a high school dropout from India who just turned 21 yesterday. My goal career-wise is to make millions or at least high six figures online/from home. I realize that school and a 9-5, freelancing and having a boss in general, isn't going to make me that much

Unfortunately, I don't have much money to invest right now and I'm an introvert, so I'm ok with starting something which may make me no money at all RIGHT NOW (That's the risk I'm willing to take) but something that has a chance of making me millions.

My interests include (in no particular order):

1. Web Development
2. Electronic Music Production (this is not really viable in my opinion as it takes a lot of money to even get in the game)
3. Chess
4. 2D Game App Development
5. Drawing
6. Writing fiction

I know this sounds naive, but I just want to give it a shot. So which one among these has the best potential to make me a millionaire considering my circumstances? Also do you have any other career ideas?

Thanks for your advice"
k191tk,,Remote in the USA - Telling Your Employer You're Moving States,"Hey all,

I just got a 100% remote role. The company is in another state my boss is in another state. We're all in the same region of the USA and time zone, though. When I got brought on, the recruiter said they were hiring for the role in any state. I also confirmed this and they said taxes would just be based on your permanent residence in case I moved states.

For those of you working remotely in the USA (and not within an hour of the office) - how do you approach the company about moving to another state? I'm about 5 hours away from the HQ right now, but I would not need to travel there. I don't want to look flakey by leaving that state I was living where they hired me, but I've been itching to move to the southwest for a while now!

k1j6fy,10lo9g,Tax evasion question from new freelancer (Autonimo) in Spain,"I'm a UK citizen and moved to Barcelona a few months ago. I recently set up as a freelancer (Autonimo) and now have to start paying my taxes. 

I have two jobs, one working as an online English teacher for a Chinese company and the other working as a Graphic Designer for a UK company. I am earning approx €1000 per month from the teaching job and €700-1000 a month from the design job. 

It's very expensive to be a freelancer here in Spain and I will have to pay 20% tax on my earnings and then €60 per month Social security payments (Going up to €150 in the second year, then €280 in the third year, flat rate regardless of income levels). This means in the the third year, if I earn €2000 in a month, I will have to pay out nearly €700 in taxes / Social security. This is a lot of money and I won't be able to get ahead if this is the case. 

I am considering only declaring my design income every month and keeping the teaching job income quiet. I get paid via Transferwise direct from China and don't have to invoice them or anything. 

Any opinions on this? Are the Spanish authorities ever likely to ever find out? What are the risks? Any tips or advice from anyone doing something similar?

So ive recently become a bit of a digital nomad. Right now with Covid it doesnt bear the same weight as it used to, but im really hoping by next year things will be a bit more open with regards to travel and freedom.

My question is, does anyone know where there are groups of like minded people and where they can be found? Im not so much talking about short term hopping into a hostel and meeting and parting ways. More people who are actually living this life in 1 or a few locations, and plan to build on it. Yes travelling but having people/a group to sometimes do it with together.

Essentially friends/people who dont have money issues, who have time on their hands, and are down to do cool stuff, exploring/camping/travelling/adventuring. I assume this must already exist, but also willing to start a new thing if no-one knows where to find it. A group for people who are free, financially sound and want to live life to the max.

It would be great if there was a place or group or website or forum of whatever it might be to meet these people. Maybe not for right now, but for the future.

It's definitely starting to affect my work performance, though I have not been called out on it yet. I'm sure the reason I am depressed is because I have nothing to look forward to or be excited about (mostly in a social context). Most of my friends have been too scared to hang out at all the past few months so I've been completely isolated. On top of that, with the recently added curfews and ban on outdoor dinings, there's officially nothing to do here. I can't take it anymore. I'm feeling really hopeless.

That being said, I've been reading about how Miami is still pretty much fully open. I'm thinking if I can move there I'll be more motivated to meet people. Simple things like working from a cafe during the day or grabbing a drink with a friend at night sound like heaven to me right now.

k5c315,8v6t7g80,"Digital Nomading in Salinas, Ecuador on a budget","Or my alternate clickbait title - living on the beach for 30 bucks a day

For me this is probably the cheapest I have traveled 

I just wanted to review how much we spent and what we spent it on to see what I can improve on, but at the same time to show everyone that traveling the world is not a costly thing. This is our total budget for [Sam](http://dirtyboyzlifestyle.com/post/slammy) and I's stay in Salinas, Ecuador.

**Tl;DR:**

Groceries: $440.54

Going out/eating out/""activities"": $467.95

Flight: $419 + Transportation: $250.19

Airbnb: $672

Total cost for the trip: $2,269.68

As you can see it was not an expensive month, 36 days technically, with a total cost of just over $1.1k per person.

Groceries: $440.54

We lived about a ten minute walk from the supermarket. It was called Mi Comisariato. It had six aisles with food, a section for fresh fruit / vegetables / meat / dairy products, and three smaller aisles for household products. While it was not a large selection they had everything we needed. I posted a couple photos so you can get a feel for what the store looked like.

Our typical shopping trip to the grocery store was as follows:

* a packet of ground beef
* six greek yogurts
* granola
* brocoli
* carrots
* bananas
* apples
* blueberries
* pineapple
* eggs
* water

We went to the store around three times a week and our cost per trip was usually around $30. Of course our total cost also included things like toilet paper, paper towels, rice, beans, laundry detergent, trash bags, and of course beer for the weekends. As you can see it was pretty easy to maintain a pretty western diet, while we were not able to find everything, it was pretty easy to keep eating what we were used to from home. Since we were there for about four and a half weeks, I would count our cost per week at about $100 or $50 per person which I think is fairly cheap.

Going out/eating out/""activities"": $467.95

This is the category where we probably could have cut back the most, we had two nights out with bar tab of over $100. Our actual activities were all free as we mostly explored on foot. Overall here the drinks were fairly cheap, $5 mixed drinks, $2-3 beers, and $5-10 meals. If Sam and I were not a little obnoxious at times it would have been pretty easy to enjoy ourselves here on the cheap. I posted a couple photos of the food, but I will go into more detail in my review of Salinas.

Flight: $419 + Transportation: $250.19

We flew from Chicago to Miami and from Miami to Guayaquil, Ecuador. From there we took a two hour cab ride to Salinas. The price here is for both of our tickets one way. The cost of the rental car we took from Pawnee to Chicago was $107, and the gas to fill up which was $23.19 which is all included in transportation.

On the way there we used Uber since it was available in Guayaquil and cost $70. On the way home we used a yellow cab which cost us $50 since there is no Uber in Salinas. I am certain that that was the ""gringo"" price and you could haggle them down a little. Additionally, there is an option to take the bus from Santa Elena, a couple miles from Salinas, to Guayaquil which only costs $5. Sam was concerned about getting to the airport on time so we decided since were splitting the cost the $20 for the cab were worth it to not have to worry. Especially once you consider that we would have had to pay for the cab to the bus station in Santa Elena and again for a cab or Uber once we arrived in Guayaquil since the bus does not drop off at the airport. Once we factored all of that in, we were fine with paying a small premium to just directly take a cab. While I feel like there was some room here to save some money, it was mostly dependent on how we valued our time by taking the bus.

Airbnb: $672

I did a full review on the Airbnb already which you can find [here](https://www.dirtyboyzlifestyle.com/post/airbnb-review-salinas-ecuador). Overall, I think the value was good. It was close to the beach, affordable, and close to a grocery store. It was a little lacking when it came to what it offered past that, since it never quiet felt like a home and some essentials were lacking. But for the price the barebones feel could also have been expected.

Total cost for the trip: $2,269.68

Again the total cost of the trip being about $1.1k for thirty-six is pretty reasonable. In theory you could cover the cost of this trip by working for $10 per hour and still have a little money to save even after paying taxes in the US. I am looking forward to doing the budget for our next stop which is Bogota in Colombia and being able to compare the two. On paper Bogota is supposed to be about 20% cheaper than Ecuador, so I will be curious to see if this will also play out in our total spending."

k5qppi,yo7ty,Anyone have experience with the short term apartment leasing startup Landing?,"Firstly, I am in no way affiliated or have any financial interest in Landing.

[Landing](https://www.hellolanding.com/) is a relatively new US-based startup started in 2019 by the founder of Shipt. They rent empty apartments from property management companies and lease them out short term for as little as 1 month. Their pitch is that they make moves easy by letting you book online (credit and background check required), furnishing each rental, setting up internet and utilities for you, and allowing you to transfer to any of their other available apartments with 30 day notice without needing to reapply, all without taking a security deposit. Think Airbnb/Vrbo for apartment units but for longer terms, and they lease the apartments and sublease to you instead of acting as a platform for owners the way Airbnb/Vrbo do.

I've been looking for a short term lease in another city. The value proposition is really there for me, and I thought that the pitch met the needs of many in this community, but I can't find much information on the company. 

The only information I can find on them are write-ups in tech journals and reviews on [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/hellolanding.com), which are a mixed bag of great reviews and really terrible ones. Of course no way to tell if all the great reviews are real.

Ill be out of town months at the time so I'd like to to add a 3rd (or more if it works) and alternate the use of the room. The living room can also be turned in 2 rooms so even if the 3 of us are in town at the same time it's not really a problem.   
I've been poking around the web to find a platform or a site promoting the same concept but didn't find anything.   
Its not a Rbnb, a house swap (I would be open to the idea too ), or some house sitting, more similar to a mountain refuge I guess ? Having a home without the hassle off having to manage one, and being less wasteful overall.  
I'm growing more wary and uncomfortable with the idea of owning things and would be super happy to put it all to communal use (furnitures etc).  


If any of the above speaks to you or if any suggestions, feel free to drop me a DM, I'll send you more info on the apartment.   
Cheers"

**Da Lat, Vietnam for Digital Nomads**

* Cost of Living: Low!
   * Incredibly low cost of living.  Grab Cars anywhere in the city, 20-40K VND ($1-2 USD).  Local food (Beef Hotpot, Chicken Hotpot, Chicken Banh Cuon), lots of Vegetarian & Vegan options, $1-5 USD per meal.
   * Rent is cheaper than bigger cities in VN (Hanoi, Saigon, DaNang).  Entire houses rent for 5-7M VND (under $300 USD) monthly.  
   * Local Beers for 20-30K VND at bars around the city.
* Transportation: Easy
   * Rent a motorbike, drive anywhere in the city within 10 minutes.  Traffic is less hectic than bigger cities in Vietnam.
   * GrabCars, GrabBikes (as mentioned above)
* Coffee Shops & Intimate Bars
   * Tons of amazing coffee shops, with high quality Arabica/blends, locally sourced beans
   * Bars and Cafes in small alleys, European vibe
   * Sleepy vibe, not a party city
* Slow, Quiet, Isolated
   * Has a very slow pace
   * Romantic but would be lonely solo

All in all, a great spot for a workcation.  Come here, chill at some great coffee shops, get some work done.  Grab a cocktail at night in a jazz bar.  Write a novel.  It's that kind of place.  

I wouldn't recommend living here long term.  Too isolated, especially for non-Vietnamese.  Not many expats or DN's living here long-term.  

Worth a visit, maybe once or twice a year if you live in Vietnam."

Then i'll consider how my remote work can become a little more remote, and maybe eventually i'll take a leap of faith.

I digress.  I am however struggling to find the ""perfect"" monitor.  I'm looking for a portable 13"" USB-c monitor that can run in portrait mode acceptably. Basically [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/AOC-I1659FWUX-16-Inch-portable-Monitor/dp/B07D36XWCC/ref=asc_df_B07DKTPH6G/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310865028479&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=3298297470897070254&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1007850&hvtargid=pla-587090935340&psc=1&th=1) but smaller, shame AOC havent done that yet.

I think my requirements are:

* USB-c because it seems to be the future, its used across all my devices, and seems the sensible choice.
* 13"" so its the same size as my laptop\*(s) so moving around with them is simplified.
* Portrait capable stand, as i believe i'll make best use of it as a second monitor for longer code review sort of stuff, mimicking how i'm already using monitors now. 

However I can't find anything on amazon or beyond that is 13"" in size that has a decent built in stand for vertical use like the AOC one linked above?  The closesest any of them come is this janky pen hole that i'm less than convinced is a good solution.

Anyone use anything that would fit my needs, or even have one with the janky pen solution and convince me it decent otherwise? :D

However iPad pro 11 or 12's are astromically expensive, and i'm not 100% sold on the mac ethos of things, I just happen to have a MBP that i don't quite make enough use of.

I need your help,"I have a goal (first milestone) to reach $3k/month passive or semi-passive income, quit my career, and travel the world on cheap 6 months/year (while learning photography and film making),,, and increasing that income in the other 6 months.

The next milestone is meeting a partner/wife who complements me, travel together until we find the most spot we like, settle there, and enjoy new hobbies and DIYs.

&#x200B;

How hard is the first milestone? Super fucking hard. At least it is for me. I've been jumping from freelancing to startups to micro SaaS to flipping flapping blopping etc lol. Long story short, I am at 0% of that $3k/month, I have even lowered it to $1k/month recently, I am fine with traveling that cheap as long as I hit it and I quit my career. But nothing yet.

&#x200B;

Freelancing through Fiverr and Upwork is not for me, toxic work environments are not for me, I have startup ideas but they are very big, need years of commitment and investing, many ties attached, etc. And my current goal is just to hit an opportunity / micro SaaS that makes $1k/month semi-passively before committing to the bigger ideas, so I can quit the career that I am fed up with and move on to a life I will enjoy much more (just hitting that $1k/month means the world to me).

&#x200B;

Can you help me in any way? I am open to your thoughts, suggestions, criticism, ideas, opportunities, etc.

EDIT 1:  My current job that's been for 2.5 years is a flexible-hours remote one!

k7iy4r,3hjcq8h3,Shall I 'nomad' or travel? Is working/living in a hostel realistic?,"I have wanted to see CA & SA for a while now. No timescale as such but I'd say a good year for sure. Starting in Mexico and ending in Brazil. Covid combined with having got laid off this summer, gave me the chance to sit back at now 30, and reflect. And I really want to travel. Briefly, I'm from the UK and am 30, with about 3 years work experience in finance & start-up sales, and then a few years of your average retail store/customer service work before Uni (I went late). I have no interest in returning to any of that corporate life however. Starting from scratch. Learning computer coding on the side and want to build this gradually. At least I actually really enjoy it so far. I currently work in a call centre to keep me ticking over, have about £30k in savings, and no remaining student debt.

I'm not sure what my best approach is. On one hand, I'd love to just volunteer at hostels and have free bed & breakfast. I'm quite economical with money so it wouldn't cost me a fortune if I managed that. But then, I'm worried about a potential 1-2 years gap on my CV in terms of work.

The alternative is I get a cushy remote customer service/support gig at a Saas company given my background. These opportunites crop up more and more and I could probably find a remote job paying £25k. That would allow me to travel through CA/SA, have a job on my CV, break even every month and most definitely as well, save some money. At least then, if I come home after 1-2 years, I have something reasonable on my CV. By reasonable, I obviously don't mean anything specialised or fancy. But it keeps me looking employable to the outside in customer facing roles in a B2B capacity.

My uncertainty with work on the road is, I don't want to be in an airbnb, all alone. In a customer service/support role, I'd probably be having to be regularly on the phone a lot and so I don't see how I could work in say a coffee shop. The worst thing I could do is have myself locked up in an airbnb all day and struggle to meet people outside of that. I'm trying to get away from 9-5 culture and living for the weekend, but if I was locked up in my airbnb all alone, I would basically be doing 9-5 and living for the weekend! Hostels seem a way better solution in terms of not having to work so hard to meet people. It's so easy. You can just go to the lounge and instantly hang out with people over a beer. Which leads me to wonder, do people live/work out of private room hostels? I can't picture somebody working out of a hostel given all the general noise and commotion? I've only stayed in your standard 10 bed rooms in hostels however, so I have no idea about ensuite rooms and whether those ensuite/private rooms in hostels are generally tucked away from all the noise in the main areas? Of course it maybe depends on the job, but I know there's a lot of ESL teachers out there travelling and they aren't earning a fortune. Would they not be staying in private rooms in hostels as well? Their job involves audio as well, hence why I pick up ESL teachers as an example.

Another point as well though is, am I underestimating the challenges of working remotely whilst travelling from Mexico all the way to Brazil in say about a year? One year is just an estimation, it could be even longer if I'm enjoying it too much.

In summary: Do I take a 1-2 years out to leave behind my disillusionment with my life, pursue my passion for travel, and volunteer for free at hostels, travelling freely, maybe casually teaching English online, and using my time to invest into coding, and just have a blasting at the expense of a hole in my CV. Or, am I better off finding a remote gig and starting that here in my home city in the UK, before at some point taking that with me on the road? Whilst trying to do some coding on the side at the same time. It's just a lot to crunch mentally, in terms of deciding the best way to go about it. Baring in mind I might not even be able to get going for a while yet as well...

Thanks!"

Don't know how to start asking this, but I'm going to give you a bit of context first. I'm an UX designer working for a big corporation. After 4 years of work in the company, I'm already burned out and a bit hopeless with finding another job in the area. I ended up hating my job, hating the internal processes, plannings, deadlines and not having energy to do other things at the end of the day.

I scaled to a good position pretty fast, and it started to consume all my mental energy.

I used to travel every month before COVID-19 and that was my relief. But this year of lockdown, accelerated to feel totally burned out, to the point I booked an one way flight to Canary islands and leave my accomodation in the UK to work remotely from there 1-3 months.

But my company didn't let me to do it. I was infuriated so I was resigning because of this. In the end, for different reasons I had to postpone it till April (so only will travel to Canary islands to rest and make some connections with other nomads when I visit)

This year I've invested a lot in education in digital marketing, social media strategies and several other digital skills during lockdown, but I don't have a product yet and my only plan so far is going somewhere in March and figure it out what to do from there. 

Is there any of you here that has left your job to become a digital entrepreneur without a clear plan? Although I'm still working in finding out my purpose and what to do I would love to hear some stories or ideas from other humans that have passed or is in a similar situation.

I have an HDMI cable I can go from the computer to the TV with but the Amazon FS is my preferred way to watch YouTube and Netflix.  
-	I attach a bottle opener to the zipper tab inside my luggage and backpack for hotels that lack a bottle opener.  I never have to think about packing one since I have one in every bag I own. 
-	I always carry a bit of duct tape in my gear.  I use an old hotel card key and I wrap some duct tape around it a few times.  Enough for an emergency fix but don’t have to keep a big roll.  
-	When I’m staying at an AirBnB, I bring a Wyze Cam and install it in the room.  They’re small and easy to set up and have motion detection.  You know if anyone is entering your room when they’re not supposed to.

Just one example: I write for an online publication (Medium) and whatever money I get there is not declared Cos I don’t have (yet—long story) a tax account number (I live in Italy). That’s just one source of income. Supposing I have more sources of income from my writing and being “self-employed” and has reach a maximum income for me not to declare it (here apparently it’s 11,000€/year), then it means yeah I have to get a tax number (it’s called partita iva here), I don’t have problems doing this....but is that what you guys have done just to make everything sort of official and not have the tax man come after you?

Can you all please share your stories and advice just so I will know what to do?

I will obvs moving out of Italy eventually but this is my country of residence and I thought I need to have all these tax stuff sorted out first before I start moving about.

Please enlighten me on this subject. You don’t have to be italian or anything I just want to know how this would work (hopefully it would also work for me). Thanks for reading."

kb58sh,ipfrq,New to Digital Nomad looking for next destination,Hey y'all I've been an official digital nomad for about 3 months and I'm starting to look for my next destinations. I have a budget of about 1500/month (not worried about flight or transportation costs to get there). I like to go out on the weekends and do activities as much as possible.  Looking for preferably a city or something with lots of events happening. Also i'm gay so a small scene for that is cool but not essential. Currently in Mexico 🇲🇽
kbas4e,9268a8ee,any graphic designers/animators in here that successfully switched to the digital nomad lifestyle?,"i am a graphic designer/ building on animation skills and also pursuing a post graduate in tesol. i’m aware teaching English isn’t the most lucrative of careers, but I really enjoy my students and like to help where I can. I’d ideally like to teach part time/for extra income wherever I end up, pandemic pending, and pursue more graphics clients. currently I am only finding clients locally and in niche short term government contracts that frown upon out of country work.

Just wondering if any designers are in here. how did you got started? how are you maintaining or gaining more clients whilst abroad? It seems like most digital nomads are developers, digital marketers, or remote customer service.

kbbehw,9182iqem,I got called a troll for saying I want to move from UK to SE,"I meant SEA, typo in the title.

So I wrote on r/IWantOut that me and my husband live in the UK, are trying for a baby, have good project management careers, mortgage, cars, and can afford nice middle class life here, however, I am not happy.

We immigrated here years ago and I am so fed up with the bad weather, with the fact that we have no family here, and the whole indoor living for at least half a year due to shit weather.

My husband is from Sri Lanka and I love it there. I love food, culture, I like his family and friends. We spend a few months there every year.

So in my mind, living there would be more enjoyable than what we have now. We would enjoy climate, fresh food, and our future kids would get to know their relatives and culture.

My husband is hesitant about going back, but I think he doesn’t believe that we can get remote jobs and live comfortably without working for local SL employers. I am pretty sure we can do this since we have extensive experience and strong careers.

So in r/IWantOut I was called a troll for even considering such move. People mentioned that this is basically ‘throwing life away’ or something like that.

Am I really crazy?

Obviously in our situation we don’t want too much movement back and forth between different countries, there will be kids and there are pets involved too."

kbk3y2,9iv6l,Has anyone tried a semi-nomadic lifestyle?,"Hi there,

I'm wondering if anyone here has experience pursuing a ""semi-nomadic"" lifestyle. Meaning, working remotely 100% of the time but doing that work in a different country for a percentage of the time rather than all the time like a ""fully nomadic"" lifestyle.

For context, the company I work for has moved to 100% remote, I'm a high performer, my boss and I have a very good relationship, and I can take 6 - 8 weeks off a year. I don't intend this to be braggy or anything, just trying to provide context.

My wife and I have been discussing the possibility of pursuing a ""semi-nomadic"" lifestyle for the next year or two once covid-19 restrictions are lifted.

We generally envision this as spending between 8 - 16 weeks of the year traveling using a combination of that time off, and working remotely. We're thinking along the lines of 4 - 8 two week trips, where one week I work remotely and we explore during the day, then I take the other week off and we treat it more vacationy. All of these numbers are shiftable, but I think you get the general idea.

Has anyone tried this sort of lifestyle? Any successes or problems? I imagine there's a lot we haven't taken into consideration so any suggestions would be hugely helpful!"
kbnfeb,57w6lokj,Working remotely for 3+ months (Jan-Mar 2021) – should I go to Brazil (Rio de Janeiro/Sao Paulo) or Colombia (Medellin/Bogota)?,"Forgive me for the long post, but I have a lot on my mind. I hope it won’t discourage anybody from skimming the post and firing off a quick response. I am just trying to get a conversation going. Although it’d be especially great to hear from anybody who has visited or lived in both countries (especially recently), any and all insight is welcomed! The only opinions I don’t want to hear are from people who will look to discourage me from travelling altogether due to the pandemic. Obviously, the corona situation has been better handled in Colombia than it is in Brazil, but I will discuss my thoughts on that a bit later. But to be clear, **I am only interested in hearing whether you guys think I should go to Brazil or Colombia, and why…**

**Some context:** I am an office worker who has been working remotely from home this past year. I would now like to work remotely from abroad from Jan-Mar 2021, possibly longer depending on how long my office stays shut. In case it’s relevant - I’m in my early 30s and would stick out like a sore thumb in either country (I’m very white and fairskinned, blonde hair, blue eyes). I only speak English, but will spend the next month trying to build some basic conversation skills, and plan to immerse myself and learn as much as I can once I touchdown. For now, my Spanish is only slightly better than my Portuguese.

**The lifestyle I hope for**: I plan to spend much of my work week indoors, parked at the computer working (I should mention that I work long hours). During the weekdays, I will only step out quickly for food, going to the gym (and BJJ if I’m in Brazil – which I realize is a high risk activity), or possibly for a swim (if I am near a beach – which would be nice but not crucial – since I am accustomed to city living and recently had a good time in the landlocked CDMX). In the evenings, I would like to experience a lively city – to meet women, go on dates, eat good food, maybe dancing if it is possible, etc. And on the weekends, I would like to indulge in fun activities, possibly take day trips to nearby cities, and enjoy some nightlife in the evenings.

I plan to find an AirBnB to stay at for at least a month at a time (since I’m technically working and not travelling, and to take advantage of discounted monthly rates). I’m not opposed to staying in one spot for the entire trip if I fall in love with it, but I imagine myself hopping on a cheap domestic flight to another major city, to find another AirBnB and another area to discover during the nights and weekends. Rinse and repeat.

In **Brazil**, I am most interested in Rio de Janeiro, and would aim to stay in Ipanema/Copacabana ($$). I’d also be interested to see Sao Paulo perhaps. The Amazon region also seems interesting, but I don’t think I could travel anyplace without cell phone coverage and internet access, even for 1 week. I realize Brazil is a massive country, with lots of diversity and cool places to visit, but honestly, I’m not very familiar with many places outside of Rio and Sao Paulo.

In **Colombia**, I am most interested in Medellin. But I’d also like to visit Bogota, and a city on the coast like Cartagena. Lower down on my list would be a stop in Barranquilla (which falls down the pecking order here since Carnival is officially cancelled this year), or Cali.

\- - -

**On the subject of living expenses,** its not much of an issue for me, although it'd be nice to save some money. Ideally, I’d like to spend no more than US$2-2.5k per month. I realize that would be a lot easier in Colombia than Brazil (especially Rio and Sao Paulo) – but that doesn’t discourage me. Colombia will always get the nod here, especially among nomads and budget conscious people. But I wonder if the current FX rates might take a bit of the sting out of living in Brazil vs Colombia – the Brazilian Real has been in freefall for years, exacerbated by the pandemic, whereas the Colombian Peso is back to trading at pre-pandemic levels. The bottom line is that while I could probably afford to live in a place in Rio right now - due to the FX rate and depressed tourism from major events like new years fireworks and Carnival being cancelled - I would only want to do it if it’s worth the extra $$ (read as: having lots of other things to do with no major restrictions). Especially when the delta in costs between Brazil/Colombia would add up quickly over my 3+ month stay.

I suspect that living expenses would be more comparable between the countries if I retreated from Rio/SaoPaulo to a more rural area of Brazil for a portion of my trip. That’s not what my heart is set on, but I am definitely open to suggestions anybody might have re: awesome and cheap places I must see while in Brazil.

**As for the hot topic COVID-19,** I recognize that Brazil has one of the highest death counts, and that their response has been a lot poorer than Colombia’s. But I also realize there is a decent chance I could catch it in either country if I am visiting bars, nightclubs (if possible), and going to gyms regularly. It’s a risk I’m willing to take, and if I got sick I imagine I would ride it out in my Airbnb rather than visit a hospital unless I felt my death was imminent. It would be no fun to get sick in either country, to be clear, and it’s not my intention to. But for me personally, how each country has managed the situation is only relevant in as far as it affects my ability to visit a bar, a nightclub, or a gym. Colombia was shut down for a period of time, and I believe their proactive approach will enable the country to loosen restrictions. On the otherhand, Brazil has always been open, which I don’t harbour any judgement towards personally - I am only worried that this could mean that stricter restrictions might be imposed there soon out of necessity as numbers spiral out of control. To summarize, I am less worried about getting sick and more worried about not having fun and facing too many restrictions. Hopefully this doesn’t ruffle too many feathers.

\*\*Some more thoughts on nightlife and current restrictions:\*\*Something I’ve been doing recently to receive a sense of how lively different cities are is watching 'virtual tours' on youtube. Specifically, I only look for videos posted in the past week, or the past month, to see how cities are recovering during the pandemic. I’ve been doing this for the last few weeks, and I’ve noticed Medellin bouncing back quite a bit recently…

Here are some recent examples:

Medellin – [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDCwLUFP-Fk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDCwLUFP-Fk)  
Sao Paulo – [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBTMBjXdv-8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBTMBjXdv-8)

But what worries me is that Sao Paulo video is the only such recent Brazilian nightlife tour I’ve been able to find. And I cannot find ANY recent videos for Rio de Janeiro! I understand the clubs are mostly closed, but when I search Lapa district in Rio, for instance, I don't see any good videos unless they are over 1 year old! This makes me worry what nightlife is currently like in Rio and Brazil more broadly. In contrast, if you look around for similar videos in Colombian cities you will find tons. After some thought, it could simply be due to the low cost of living in Colombia vs major Brazilian cities – which would probably attract more youtube content creators, as well as other digital nomads. But I’m not sure. If anybody has any insights, it would be much appreciated."

kbyf26,6pslei5o,Time zone difference website?,"Hi everyone 

This might be confusing but I'll try to explain the best I can.  Right now I work 9-5 ET hours and have to keep those hours as long as I'm a full time employee, but I'm allowed to work anywhere in the world.  I like to run dozens of scenarios like,  ""what if I changed my hours to 12-8 to half-support the team in Australia?"" or ""what if I worked part time, 11-3, 12-4,  or even 9pm-midnight?""

The follow up question is:  What areas of the world could I live in and work normal hours to support those above questions

Is there a website that would help me figure this out?  What I envision is a world time zone map - you pick one of the time zones and enter the start time and end time.  The rest of the time zones would calculate what time it would be in local time, which would make it super easy to scan the globe and see the areas that would work for you

For example: I need to work 9am to 5pm in the -5 time zone ...  Thailand's time zone (+7) would automatically calculate as 9pm to 5am.  So immediately I would know I can't work in Thailand.  But all the time zones would be listed out so it would be super easy to visually figure out which areas would work.

I know this is super easy to calculate manually... but again I run so many scenarios in my head that it gets tiring to figure out what country works and what doesn't.   This would also be a super easy website to build if anyone is interested...

Hi everyone! 

I’ve been lurking around on this sub but feel like I might still need a little help figuring out my specific situation. 

I will get help from a tax person either in California or France as soon as I can/can afford it. In the mean time I was wondering if any of you had any insight/information about this:

I’m French. I live with my parents in France and until March, I had never lived elsewhere. 
My mom is American. When I started dating my boyfriend who’s also American, living in California,  it just seemed easier to get my American citizenship to be able to go back and forth.

I’ve been staying with him and his family since March. 
All I have connecting me to California are my voters card and their address on my bank account (only way I could open one here to get paid for my new job)

I just got a job as an independent contractor that I can do remotely and will be going back to France next week. I plan to keep up with work while there and don’t know yet how long I’ll be staying in France. 

I wanted to know how taxes would work with having both citizenships and working my job in both countries, also knowing that I’m not exactly settled in either right now (no rent/real estate, major bills etc)"

So if I lose everything and I somehow scrounge up enough $ to purchase a cheap Android cellphone locally, and gain internet access via a purchase SIM card or free WiFi, then what?

I tried to simulate this today and I factory reset my Android smartphone.  Upon reboot, during the phone's setup I was prompted to enter in my Gmail account and password, but I do not know this password, as it is stored in Lastpass for me.  Not being able to sign into Gmail means I cannot access the Google Play store to download Lastpass where my ""keys to the castle"" (login information as well as backup codes and whatnot) are stored.  So I decided to log  into [Lastpass.com](https://Lastpass.com) using the factory-provided, outdated Chrome browser (I currently DO NOT have 2FA enabled...I could not find the option within their 2FA to download backup codes).  I was able to login, but the way the website was displayed did not allow me to actually use it.  Menus were overlapping each other and I saw no way to access the search bar and search for login information for specific websites.  Of course updating the Chrome browser or downloading any other browser in hopes that it was display [Lastpass.com](https://Lastpass.com) on a mobile device any better was out of the question because I could not log into the Google Play store.

So I was stuck and had to rely on my laptop to help me configure the ""new"" cellphone and login to various sites. Obviously I failed in my simulation and I'm looking for advice from those of you living out of a backpack on how you guys safeguard yourselves in a situation like this where you lose everything?  

Ideally I'd like to be self-sufficient in this situation where I did not have to rely on calling a family member with my Gmail pwd locked in their safe kind of thing.  And to be honest that would not work because even if I was able to obtain the Gmail pwd from them, I have 2FA setup on my Gmail and that would require a backup code, which is stored in my Lastpass... so again, I wouldn't even be able to log into the Play Store and download the Lastpass app, enter in my master password (again, I do not currently have 2FA enabled, I could not find the option to download backup codes, but ideally I'd like to), and gain access to all my login information + backup codes for websites/services I use 2FA.

Is there a better way to accomplish my goals?  What do you guys do to safeguard yourselves?  Many thanks!"

And my first and most obvious question... How's internet in there?

&#x200B;

I stayed for a few days a month ago and I was getting okay-ish connection, even made a speed test on the Airbnb I was staying at (a street away from the main corredor) and got 20 mbps down and 2 mbps up, not bad but, it gets better than this, right?

&#x200B;

Also, how is crime in general?

&#x200B;

The reason I want to move from Oaxaca is that the city is so unstable right now and I'm right now directly experiencing this:

* Someone broke into my car; now I need to get a new window and buy a new stereo, no big deal.
* People is being killed and mugged just a couple of streets away from my supposedly safe neighborhood.
* Blockades all over the city and some main roads; had to drive for almost 8 hours to get back home from Puebla when it usually takes 3.5-4 hours.
* I'm starting to have water issues.
* I try not to drive a lot in the city and only for visiting pueblos, but the streets and roads across the State are a complete **nightmare** and have to put more money into my car for maintenance... This didn't happen in Chiapas, although it was a quick visit but a very remarkable difference vs Oaxaca.

kdd34o,juox1,Digital Nomad Quick Start Guide,"This will be a quick start guide and will cover things that are applicable to most people. One of the reasons it is so difficult to give advice is because most of your research should be done on the country and individual city you want to go to. Also my experience as a straight white male will be different from your experience if you are not one and will add another level of research you need to do. This whole lifestyle is based upon your ability to research, plan, and execute.

Will your company know you are out of the country. Yes, IP address. Can I use a VPN or virtual machine? Maybe, it depends on how technical you are.

**Doing your research:**

This whole lifestyle is based upon your ability to research.  You remember writing research papers in highschool and college? Well living somewhere for an extended period takes extensive research if you want to have a high quality of life and not constantly on the struggle bus. You should be able to write a short paper or at the very least have a conversation on the city and country you are going to. This is why it is so hard to give advice because most of the info you need to thrive is very specific to the location. How do I research? Start on Wikipedia, check Youtube videos, search Amazon Prime or Netflix for an episode related to where you are going.

**Observe and do not judge:**

You are a guest in whatever country/city you are in, please have some goddamn respect. If you don’t like the taste of something don’t say it is gross, be polite about it. You are not there to change their entire culture overnight, observe objectively that the people and their culture are different than you and yours. Also don’t pet the cats and dogs in the streets.

**The Basics**

**Finding a long term rental:**

Entry level here would be Airbnb, you can negotiate directly with the host for a good long term discount. Read the reviews. Know what you are looking for, hostels are great fun but difficult to work from. When traveling on vacation I love hostels, when working, I prefer my own space.

Advanced level, local rentals from Facebook marketplace or the country equivalent of Craigslist. Usually you can Google “Craigslist of X” and you can get an idea of where to look for rentals and other stuff. Look for furnished apartments with all utilities included.

**What to bring:**

Always assume whatever you bring will get lost or stolen, have a plan to recover from that incident. Besides the obvious stuff, I like to have a cheap local cell phone. This way if it is lost or stolen, I will not be too upset about it and have my US phone as backup. Ear plugs, bring 3 pairs, thank me later, also a sleep/eye cover mask. Portable battery bank, don’t get something crazy big, but this has saved me when I was in the middle of nowhere countless times. Sticky notes.

You most likely do not need all the clothes you packed. Take inventory during a trip of what you actually wear. Many things can be bought where you are going! Shocker. Too many people pack things that can easily be bought where you are going, if you have space fine.

**Money:**

Do your research here. Most of the time, the cheapest way to get money is from an ATM withdraw AT A BANK. Please stop withdrawing money from the ATM in the middle of the sidewalk. I bring two ATM cards from different banks as a just in case.

International credit card: Something without a foreign transaction fee that is actually accepted around the world.

**What to do:**

Ask for suggestions from locals. Get a haircut. Try different foods. Make friends. Go to the gym. Have hobbies. Be a well rounded person. Do you research! Save places on Google Maps. Traveling can be very lonely, if you like rock climbing go rock climbing, this is how you make friends. You do the things you enjoy and find other people who enjoy those things too. Drinking beer is not a personality.

**Apps:**

Translate- download offline package.

Maps.me- literal life saver.

Alltrails- Hiking trails.

Uber/Cabify/Grab etc

**Getting around:**

If you plan ahead like you are going to do, you can prepare airport transportation for half the cost of a taxi. Use the apps that are specific to your local. Use the damn bus! The bus will almost always cover your needs and is the cheapest option. You will almost always make a new memory riding public transportation in other countries.

**Taxes:**

Ask a professional from your country, end of discussion.

**Insurance:**

Travel and renters insurance can be great and cover your items if they are lost or stolen while abroad. Usually very reasonably priced.

Car insurance- your credit card should have car rental insurance. You will want to read up on it and do your research. One of THE MOST COMMON SCAMS is car rental insurance. Thanks Costa Rica.

**How to travel cheaply:**

Google flights has a “explore destinations” button. This is honestly how I decide where to go. You can find cheap flights all around, round trip. Flight cost is the main factor when people tell me how expensive travel is.

Using credit cards. Honestly check out Nerdwallet.com it is a great website, you can protect yourself from fraud by using a credit card and reaping rewards. You can also freeze your card if lost or stolen, and any money spent is the credit card companies money, not yours.

**Final thoughts:**

Travel is hard, and it takes a lot of experience to figure things out. Experience will keep you safe and out of danger and will allow you to become more adventurous as you understand how things are done. Making friends can be hard, you will be alone, and sometimes you will be lonely. Don’t judge people, your fellow travelers looking to get coked up and party at their resort or the folks who have to deal with them for a job.

Thailand seems to be a good option right now (very low COVID numbers & a state-enforced quarantine to stop the spread). However, I'm concerned I won't meet many other DNs/ex-pats. 

I'm also considering Bali - but there's no state enforced quarantine & the COVID numbers don't look good - so it kinda feels irresponsible going. However - I'd be way more likely to meet DNs here. 

Where would you recommend?"
kf3f4y,3jrjxibe,Where can I live on less than $2000 USD for long term? Also wondering about long term travelers who have severe food allergies and medications issues,"Sorry if this is super long but I want to be as precise as possible!

&#x200B;

I currently work and live in the Midwest (USA) - been working from home for the past 4 years or so. My monthly income after taxes and retirement is around $2,000 USD give or take. My only real monthly expenses are rent ($700 USD), health insurance ($180 USD), cell phone bill (unlocked - unlimited data at $50 USD) and student loans ($250 USD), I don't have any credit card debt or other outstanding balances. I would ideally like a place where I wouldn’t spend my whole monthly income but would be able to save some money each month. English is my main language but I speak, read and understand Spanish pretty well (Spanish from Spain does confuse me though with their pronunciation/accent). 

&#x200B;

Fast internet is my #1 requirement, I have a graphic design job and need at the very, very minimum at least 30MB DOWN/6 MB UP.

&#x200B;

Since I work from home I have the option to work remotely, but my main concerns about working abroad for long term are dealing with medications and food allergies. I have asthma - not so bad that I can't leave the house but bad enough that I never leave my home without my albuterol rescue inhaler. I'm relatively active and when I am in my home city I feel pretty confident going about with hikes and long walks (5+ miles) but I am a little bit concerned about being in a country that I can't speak the language and having an asthma attack. How do people with other serious medical conditions deal with this? I'd love to hear from any of you who may have a similar issue. I've traveled abroad before and never had any health issues but it's only been for a week or two at a time at the most.

&#x200B;

I also have some serious food allergies. I'm allergic to shellfish/crustaceans/most seafood other than fish. Also to all poultry/dairy/carrots/celery/peas/beans/legumes and quite a few random fruits. I mostly cook for myself and am comfortable doing that at home so I can easily avoid my allergens. I have also traveled abroad to Vietnam/Cambodia/The UK/Netherlands/Latvia/Lithuania and ate mostly fast food and shitty American type food, so while I avoided my allergens I also ate and felt like shit the whole time. I also always carry around my Epipen on me at all times just in case. I have read a lot online how ""eating like a local"" can be cheap and save you money, but in my situation it isn't very practical to eat street food however I am ok with doing all of my own cooking.

Just curious how others who may have serious medical/food allergy issues deal with long term travel and may have lived in relatively cheaper locations? Are you able to get a years worth of medications/inhalers/etc in advance to take with you? Any kind of insight would be greatly appreciated :)


ETA: I feel I should mention I am a gay, 30/yo male although I don’t look or act “stereotypically” gay. I’m not looking for a gay neighborhood or a party city but I don’t want to worry about having to hide my sexuality if it comes up (not that I bring it up to strangers all the time)."
kf678d,l440a,Friendliest Country?,"If you search the internet by typical means, you will see Portugal written up as the friendliest country in the world all over the place - friendliest, easiest for expats to settle, warmest welcome from locals, on and on.  Except, this being the ninth country I've lived, I can say the bureaucratic hell for settling in is flat-out remarkable, the constant stories from other expats about how closed off and unfriendly the Portuguese are trumps the media, and the racial violence (Brazilians murdered for being Brazilian in Lisbon a few months ago) and CONSTANT flow of racist comments in local online communities can only go to show just how much these people HATE foreigners.  

So... don't trust the internet seems to be the lesson in all this, but I thought why not get anecdotes from other travelers rather than some media outlet where the author had probably never been to any of the countries mentioned.

I'll give my pick, to kick things off.  Serbia.  I can only speak from personal experience, but I found the bureaucracy to be the easiest to navigate (even government workers were incredibly helpful to me) and most lenient as long as you are respectable.  People were just insanely friendly - catching a girl at a bar smoking a spliff and then getting some excellent Amsterdam-quality buds from her a couple weeks later and being invited in from the cold, offered a rakija, and then invited to go with her and her friends to an underground jazz show; a small business owner refusing my money and talking with me about his life past closing hours, literally leaving the store open an extra 30 minutes just to talk with me about his experiences in the States where he lived for a decade, his pregnant wife, the bombing in the 90s, what it's like running a small business in Serbia, and so on; landlord telling me if I ever left Belgrade, I'd be welcome to stay with him and his family should I ever want to come back and visit...  it goes on.  People were just SO FUCKING FRIENDLY.  I am ambiverted, for the most part, but lean introvert, and at times it almost felt like I should take a step back, but it was so easy to meet people there.  The long-term apartment hunt was a little arduous, but if you're not picky, as long as you have a reasonable budget, it's easy (I paid 400/mo for a large one-bedroom with large living room, two balconies, full eat-in kitchen, washer, next to a large park).  

So, I'm curious as to places where people were truly impressed by how friendly it was.   Talking places you've spent more than a couple weeks, preferably have gotten residency.  What are your picks, and why?"
kfd6vl,aw9rr,Any sports bettors here?,"I've been betting full time since the start of this year, and since I live in one of the most expensive countries on the planet, I thought why not go nomad.

Would love to hear about different experiences, and hear about how bad or good the various bookies are when it comes to betting outside of your country.

kfn752,5yffxoqw,Moving out as a young person!,"Hey everyone!

I'm not so sure this is the right sub for this but I believe you guys as DNs share a lot of qualities that i'm thriving to adapt in my life! I've been thinking a lot lately about spreading my wings. There is obviously a lot of pros and cons when it comes to such a ""life changing"" decision right? I was hoping to be able to share my situation and look for advice from people who have already succeeded!

**Who I am:** First of all, i'm from Ireland! I'm also 21 years old. I have never attended any higher level education and i'm currently working part-time as a customer assistant in a store! I live in Dublin where requirement of living is nearly impossible for a person of my age with so little experience. My story leading up to this point is quite miserable, so I won't go too much into that but long story short i'm living on a kitchen floor. No space to breathe, no room to focus and no area to learn. I've got no real responsibilities, no family and no friends so relocating in terms of international levels is not a concern for me, in fact, because of Irish culture i'm more obliged to move abroad in due time.

**My situation:** I've been living in this kitchen for almost 2 years now. It is starting to get the best of me. However, I won't let it! I really want to learn, i want to do some soul searching, truly find what I want to do with my life, find purpose and of course establish a career path. In order for me to do this, I need my own SPACE! The problem is, with all this motivation for success comes great change! Change is scary. It is basically a high risk - high reward situation but I'm at the lowest of lows, so in hindsight, its quite a positive thing since i've got nothing to lose.

**What I want to do:** I don't know how realistic it is for a 21 year old guy to move far away, find a place, find a job, start learning some skills and develop themselves along the way. I don't know if its possible, however, i'm down to give it a go! The plan I have in my head right now, is to work in my store building up some more cash for the next 3 months or so, at least until this vaccine rolls out! From there i'd like to find a studio apartment somewhere in Europe, find a job to pay the bills and start learning some essential skills like IT, Business and working on some digital art, like i've always wanted to do!

**My fears:** I'm quite a spontaneous person, bravery is on my side, it has to be when you've got nobody around you. However, it's unsettling to think about. You know, what if this goes wrong? what if that goes wrong? how much money do I need to go? what if I run out of money? what if I cant choose a career? all of these questions start to fill your head! Obviously, that brings quite a lot of anxiety, stress and whatever else it may be. Now, dealing with those emotions isn't my problem, heck i've been doing that for years but being able to overcome them and really make it work is the issue.

**What should I do?** At this point you know my situation, you know my background, you know what kind of experience I have and what I want to do moving forward! I need your word, need clarification! If you were in my position, what would YOU do? If you're with me, what kind of countries would you start looking at? what are some things you'd definitely need to have before going? should I get educated first? how do I even handle contracts? am I crazy? you know, things like that haha!

Few things to note, I don't want this post to be strictly about me, in fact, i'd love people to come here, share their thoughts, their experiences and if you're in the same position as me hopefully you can take something from this too! I want to connect with people, find how others are dealing with same decision and for those who have succeeded id love to pick your brain a little!

Thanks for reading! I appreciate all the help you can give me!

Peace and love <3"

The idea is to city-hop, visiting a new one every month.  I'm planning that due to both the aforementioned making up lost time, and the hopes that crunching a city's nightlife will help to alleviate the isolation / loneliness that comes from traveling alone, as my search for a companion remains fruitless.

kgzo2q,tyko3,Places in the US timezone with beautiful accessible nature?,"Hi,

What places in the US timezone/Americas would you recommend me if I'm looking for the following things:

- Accessible nature: Could be forest, mountains etc. Beach would be nice but not necessary, and I'd rather have forests and mountains where I can go hiking instead of just having a beach and nothing else. And as mentioned, it's important that it's accessible, because I know that there's lots of places in Latin America that have beautiful nature but the nature isn't really accessible because there are no trails or or it's simply too dangerous.

- OK internet: I don't need the best and fastest internet on the planet, but it should be working

-  Community: I don't care about having a huge expat community, but some sort of expat community should def exist, even if it's small. Coworking offices are a plus. I'd be happy to make local friends as well.

- Price: No extremely expensive (no NYC/LA prices) , but I'm happy to pay a little more for the right place.

- Climate: Open to anything, except of places that are quite cold year-round (like Bogota)


... That's pretty much it. I'd consider places anywhere in the US timezone, even in the US so if you have any US suggestions I' be happy to hear them too.


Thanks!!"

I thought about just shipping it, but I don’t have a lot of confidence that it will reach my building in El Pablado. 

If it’s too much of a mission, I can always leave it stored and just bring my laptop. I don’t want to though. I always need like 50 tabs open for work which get super hard to keep track of on my laptop screen. The monitor is a game changer.

kh9nfw,8525mgit,I built a chrome extension that helps you find Airbnbs with fast WiFi,"I was frustrated while trying to find Airbnbs that I could work remotely from. It's a pain to message every host asking for their internet speeds and hope for a response. I realized that if I could at least filter down to the areas with good internet, my messages could be much more targeted.

After some searching, I found a great dataset courtesy of Google. Every time someone runs a speed test using the Google speed test widget, the data is recorded and is queryable. This year I had been planning a trip to French Polynesia, but using this data I could see that they do not have fast internet! Luckily I was able to pivot and instead found a great place in Hawaii.

I wanted to make this process WAY easier...so I made a chrome extension. Now you can see the expected internet speeds whenever you are viewing an Airbnb listing. Safe travels, and let me know what you think!
