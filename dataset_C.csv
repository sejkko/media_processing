khtur2,1rqskn7p,What has been your biggest trouble lately?,"Just curious what other digital nomads have been dealing with in the recent weeks or months, besides the obvious. Am hoping we can help each other out or even potentially work on solutions together! (maybe that's a little too ambitious haha). 

I'll go first. Because of external circumstances, my old routine has been thrown out the window and I'm struggling to get back into the groove of things. I took most of yesterday to re-prioritize the things I needed to do and didn't need to do, and am trying to find a regular schedule to do those things."
khxss7,12nwwb,any pleasant surprises working remote with people in cities that were off your radar?,"Working remote is great.  You can live in whatever city works best for you and work with teams in cities where you would have never even considered living.  I'm currently living in Vegas but most of my team lives in Tulsa, OK and one Indian guy lives in Nashville.  One of my favorite teams in years!  Have you had any types of similar surprises like this?"
ki24gb,bda8m,Earliest way to get a COVID vaccine?,I’m seeing UAE has an active vaccination program for all citizens and residents. They’re using the Chinese vaccine however. Looks to be 86% effective which is good enough for me. Would prefer to get the Pfizer but it looks like that’s months away everywhere unless you’re high risk. Is UAE the best bet?

ki8nux,4rmf2sba,What’s up with the lack of couth at coworks?,"So this is an honest question. I thought lacking couth was an American thing, but apparently it’s universal, or maybe I’m just particularly bothered by it? I’m surprised time and time again with people watching videos on their phone at full volume, or editing a video without headphones, or just ripping 45 minutes zoom calls when they could easily step outside, or taking FaceTime calls to their clients. No joke, right now as I type this I’m watching a dude Tony Robbins someone on a FaceTime call trying to convince him to work with him to become his best self and conquer his inner child for a *small monthly fee. It’s basically a truism that you’re going to have at least one person without any social awareness at a cowork. 

Again, I may just be overly sensitive to this. I’ve always been annoyed when people don’t take into account others in social situations (speaker phone calls in grocery lines, dinner parties where someone dominates the conversation with stories about themselves, people blasting their own music at hostels) Like in my brain, the conventions of a cowork should match that of a library as best they can. Be respectful of the space, don’t let what you’re doing bleed over into what someone else is doing, and just read the damn room. Does anyone have any guess to why this is though? Does the digital nomad life inherently attract those who lack social awareness? Is it cultural? Or am I just a Karen? Haha alright, rant over."
ki95a2,deiup,Paying the dreaded taxman,"Disclaimer #1: I checked the wiki and the only tax related entry was [utterly useless](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/b1hjq8/digital_nomad_newbie_survival_kit_faq_for/ein0rpg/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=digitalnomad&utm_content=t3_b1hjq8), and tried searching inside the subreddit but all the posts I found were very context specific. Hence why I'm making a new post.

Disclaimer #2: These are currently hypothetical situations.


Disclaimer #3: I don't want to get into trouble or break any laws, but of course if I can pay the taxman the least amount possible life would be nicer.

Who would I pay tax to in the following situations (both self-employed, freelance contractors):


(A) **Working in the U.K.** for a foreign employer/foreign clients. Paid in the foreign currency into a bank account of my choosing (could be a UK account, a Japanese account, or an online bank like Paypal/Revolut)


(B) **Working abroad** for a foreign employer/foreign clients. Paid in the foreign currency into a bank account of my choosing (could be a UK account, a Japanese account, or an online bank like Paypal/Revolut)

kk1mwq,1901bhsb,Correct software for remote pc control?,"Hi, I am looking for a software that would allow me to connect to a computer at home (that I have access too if I need to set it up) that allows me to basically have full control as well as allow audio from that computer to come through the computer im using from my end as well as allow me to connect my webcam to that computer. So basically I am looking for something that allows full remote control, as well as complete audio sharing and webcam sharing, say for example if I wanted to make a skype call from the remote pc, I would like to be able to talk through my mic on my pc and have it go to the person I am talking to on skype through the remote pc as well as hear everything the person talking through skype on the remote pc is saying through the speaker on the pc on my end. Same for the webcam, I would like to use the webcam on my pc to show to the person in the skype call on the remote pc.

Sorry if this is a little confusing and it may be the wrong subreddit to ask it in, but I have tried many remote connect software like zohoassist, logmein, connectwise, teamviewer, anydesk, etc.. and they do remote control just fine, but when I try to use my webcam from my host pc to connect to the remote pc it gives me issues, same with the audio. Maybe I need to do more troubleshooting, but if you guys know a software that for sure can meet these needs, I would really appreciate to hear about them so I can give them a try myself. Thanks!"

I've done some research and based on best access to wifi my current considerations are Argentina (BA), Mexico (DF, PV), and Colombia (Medellin).  

I've traveled to many countries (including Central and South America) but I have never actually worked remotely, let alone during a pandemic.   

I know this might sound ridiculous given the current state of things, but I've heard from traveling buddies that in certain places in Latin America (such as PV) they're actually more proactive about sanitation and precautions than most places in the US.  Also, I take every precaution necessary myself but I'm not overly concerned if I actually get the virus myself since I'm young and healthy."

&#x200B;

As the title suggests, where do you owe taxes if you travel around frequently enough that no minimum permanent residency criteria is achieved for any state or country?  

I have looked at buying property in a few areas and even then, most US states say I would need to spend 183 days in a particular state to claim primary residency - therefore owing taxes to that particular state. Puerto Rico would require 183 days in Puerto Rico with no more than 90 days in the US. 

Obviously, if I was international, I would still owe federal taxes. Curious if anyone has dealt with this directly?"

klc1yk,8yp6lyp7,Unsure if my company will be remote forever,"Disclaimer: it’s not at all my intention to be insensitive. I know people are hurting really bad due to the pandemic/economy. This is in regards to my life only.

Okay, I’m so happy that one of the externalities of the pandemic was remote work. Context is that I just graduated from college and got hired on as a data analyst at the company I interned at over summer.

It’s great working remote and I’ve always dreamt of being nomadic and living in a diff state for a few months at a time. 

However, I work at a company that’s all about “people” and hanging out.

In reality, they just pay a massive lease on a “cool” office that they wanna get their value out of.

I don’t care to be a part of company culture or hangout with my coworkers. I’m more than happy just doing my job and being in control of my life.

They want to bring us back when things get better. They think summer at the earliest. 

They promised some degree of remote work for commuters/parents but I’m wondering if it will be team by team basis or some split of the week.

There’s some sort of kool-aid in this company where people *want* to get back which I just don’t get.

Should I start looking for work at a big tech company that’s 100% remote or just wait it out?"

klnwak,3psfb76m,Digital Nomad Advice I Would Give My Younger Self,"I was given a prompt by a friend and fellow digital nomad to address the issue in the title. I have come up with 5 things and wrote about them [HERE](https://medium.com/world-travelers-blog/digital-nomad-advice-i-would-give-my-younger-self-1d2e8edab24?sk=e8d0a4df9f188817a5e2be47c1965a98)

To summarize:

First, create multiple income streams as soon as possible. This is probably the most important thing I should have done earlier. Starting this virtuous cycle has changed everything.

Second, embrace minimalism and frugality. Less consumerism, more money, less stress.

Third, travel more. Get that experience.

Fourth, live a healthier lifestyle.

Fifth, start house hacking yesterday! This ties back into #1, that house would have been paid off by now (using someone else's money no less).

 

I leverage everything I have done in the past (education, writing experience, thru-hiking and minimalism skills, finance know-how, etc) to keep the ball rolling. I believe we, as a society, will find this lifestyle of location-independent income becomes easier year after year.

The real key to success here is to start as early as you can. If you haven’t already taken the first step, do it now!

I hope you find the article interesting, let me know what advice you would give your younger self to get off on the right foot."

As someone who never had his own apartment with furniture and ""stuff"", I was wondering how long it would take to get rid of all of that ""stuff"" if I decided to go travel again. 

If you had a ""settled"" lifestyle before nomading, how long did it take you from the moment you decided you wanted a nomadic lifestyle to the moment where you had actually sold everything off and were ready to leave? Disregarding:

- Home rental contracts / selling property and stuff like that
- Everything job related, I already work remotely

kmwvud,14xksx,How do I make friends with locals?,"I feel like I’m back in Kindergarten asking this question, but how do I make friends? I’m strongly considering working remotely abroad once covid ends, bouncing back and forth between countries that allow remote work on tourist visas. Here in Seattle, I initially made friends through meetups and coworkers, and the ball just keeps rolling with friends of friends. But how can I do this while working remotely abroad? I’ll have no local coworkers, and meetups seem to be small or non-existent in a lot of countries. I would prefer to meet locals who are comfortable with me not being able to speak their language very well, as opposed to expats (see “about me”).

In case you're curious, I'm planning to visit:

* Munich, Germany
* Osaka, Japan
* Taipei, Taiwan
* Santiago/Valparaiso, Chile or Buenos Aires, Argentina
* Kyiv, Ukraine
* Hanoi, Vietnam

Current ideas:

* Apartment buildings that host social events - This is a big thing in Seattle and I’m wondering if it exists in other cities. Large high-rise apartment buildings in Seattle have common areas shared by the whole building for hanging out, watching movies, playing boardgames, grilling, etc. Better yet, the apartment buildings often put together social events like pancake brunches or movie nights for people to meet. Is this just a Seattle thing?
* English language exchanges - Maybe I could find local organizations that host casual social events to interact with English speakers?
* Couchsurfing events - I don’t like the idea of sleeping on someone’s couch for free, but I wouldn’t mind getting my own place and still hanging out with the host. It also sounds like there are social couchsurfing events in a lot of cities. Does anybody have any experiences to share?
* Roommates - I could couch surf or airbnb in a shared apartment (or similarly find a shared apartment on a local website). This option doesn’t appeal to me since I prefer having my own space if I’m going to be working.
* Dating apps - I feel like this would be great for hookups or dating (which I would be open to). However, I think that making friends would be my higher priority, and I find that very few dates on dating apps lead to lasting friendships (in the US, at least (or maybe I just suck)). And I’ve never had an online date introduce me to her friends. There’s just a lot of room for complications here, right? I don’t want to go around breaking any hearts ;)
* BumbleBFF - I doubt anybody uses it outside of the US. I’ve also always felt it was a bit awkward as a man, but I could get over that.
* Bars - I could play the traditional approach of going around at bars (or anywhere really) striking up conversation, but I feel like whenever a random stranger approaches me in the United States, I assume it’s either a sexual advance or they’re trying to sell me something. I feel like I’d be sending the wrong message. But maybe I’d seem more genuine with a line like “I’m a foreigner who just moved here and I have no friends” ;)
* Meetups, Facebook groups & events - as mentioned before, they seem spottier outside the US. I also get the impression that they’d be more popular with expats than locals.
* Coworking spaces - expensive, and probably mostly expats, not locals. Right?

About me:

I am currently a tech worker in Seattle. I am fairly extroverted, social, and can talk to just about anyone. I’m not shy. I love learning about other cultures, seeing the world, and learning foreign languages. I’m 30 and my parents think that it’s time for me to get married and settle down, but I feel like there’s so much of the world that I still want to see and I don’t think that there’s any better time than now, while I’m single and still kinda young. I could go on yearly vacations for the rest of my life, but I yearn for a deeper view than what I’d see as a tourist. I want to actually live abroad, immerse myself in the culture, and make friends. I used to speak German and French pretty fluently, and I took 1-2 years each of Mandarin, Spanish, and Japanese in college. I’ve also recently started learning a bit of Russian. So languages are a big part of my motivation. That’s why I’d prefer to meet mostly locals, not expats. My study abroad in Germany was wasted a bit because I sheltered myself with the comfortable crowd of other english-speaking exchange students, and I’d like to not repeat the same mistake. That being said, I don’t feel super comfortable in Russian, Mandarin, or Japanese, so I’m hoping to meet locals who are somewhat comfortable in English and interested in a language exchange.

Ideally, I’d plan on spending six months or so in each country (maybe split into two 3-month chunks on tourist visas). I will probably hire a Russian tutor while living in Kyiv since the city is a blend of Russian-speaking and Ukranian-speaking. I would live in Russia, but visas are a nightmare. With the exception of Vietnam, I’d plan on building my fluency in the local language. Learning Vietnamese doesn’t sound practical to me since I don’t speak it yet and it’s not a major world language, but it seems like an interesting culture to me. Besides, it seemed English-friendly from my previous visit."
kmy7zk,3k3s2oci,Should I pursue UX or Software Development?,"I’m a recent psych bachelors grad and I’ve recently accepted that I’ll have to hustle for the next 5 or more years teaching myself a new skillset to start a career that would allow me to pursue life as a DN while also earning decent money. From what I’ve researched UX and Software Dev are two of the most in demand remote jobs that can in theory be self-taught. For UX it’s more connected to my degree and interests but I’m honestly not that great at designing. With enough effort I can churn out a nice looking presentation or even an ok social media release if needed. I do have an eye for aesthetics but I’m inept at applying them to my own work (is this a skill that can be developed). For software dev I enjoyed learning to code in highschool and was even relatively good but ultimately didn’t pursue it since compared to my classmates who were the best and who ended up pursuing CS in uni, I wasn’t at the same level. 

I’m willing to put in the work for either if it will get me closer to my goals, but I’d appreciate some of your thoughts on which field I’m more likely to find success in. Or if my mindset’s completely wrong feel free to tell me lol"

I tried discussing all of this with a family member who kind of thinks life is ""you get a job, you find a house, you get married... etc"" and, unsurprisingly, they think I'm insane for this idea. So I guess I have two questions:

1. How do you explain this lifestyle to people who just don't get it? I'm assuming this same issue comes up with people in bigger companies having to deal with HR over working remotely.
2. Is it naive to want to do the work-travel thing in Colombia? Is my family member justified in being skeptical? I'm sure it takes increased awareness and safety measures, but I don't think it's so insane to want to live in Colombia for a couple of months!"

My S-Corp is set up in California, using the same address as my parents since that makes it convenient whenever I have mail. But with the way things are going in California, I am looking to move my business as I make more money. I don't trust the state politically and there's no need for me to have a physical location there since I travel 11-12 months of the year.

Which state would be best to move to? I've heard of companies that allow you to set up a small office, with a real physical address (not a PO Box), that is specifically designed for digital nomads. That is, little to no rent and maybe even some services like mail monitoring or a landline. 

Ideally, the state would also be great to have a home in as well. I'm looking to invest in real estate in the US soon. While it will be hard to beat California weather, it's not that big of a deal since I can travel elsewhere during winter.

TLDR: Which state is best for digital nomads when it comes to services that accommodate a remote lifestyle and paying as little as possible in taxes?"

I REALLY enjoyed it, but I took a week off work to do it because I wasn't sure how it would go. I ended up staying some nicer campgrounds with power and internet that would have been fine to work at, some places I stayed were pretty off grid with no mobile signal or electricity at all, though you pass through towns at least daily.

I'd love to do something like this again, but preferably something longer where I could work along the way. I have a 9-5 but but it's very flexible so working weird hours or missing some meetings is ok, but generally I need to be connected. For this I need two things: power and internet. 

For internet I don't need anything crazy (5mb?) and my work is pretty flexible, so as long as there's decently available mobile signal I can tether and it should be fine.

Power is harder. My phone can be powered by combo of battery (as long as I can charge it once every 3 days or so) and solar panel, but my MBP uses a TON of juice due to the software I need to run and would need to be charged probably at least twice a day if not 3-4 times. I don't think I could rely on a battery or solar, it wouldn't charge fast enough and if there were bad weather I'd be screwed.

So I'm wondering if anyone has done a walking trip like this or is aware of a route where electricity is fairly reliable? I understand the Camino de Santiago is a popular one and has lots of inns, but is there anything else?

- Seattle, WA 
- Vancouver, BC (if border reopens)
- San Francisco, CA

- hiking within ~1.5 hour drive, lots of trails accessible with my MINI cooper and dog-friendly trails
- dog-friendly city and friendly people (transplant cities are ideal as it’ll be likely easier to make friends)
- good diversity of people and food (vegetarian/fish options since I don’t eat other meat) 
- generally safe city to explore/walk around in
- good dating scene for single/late twenties
- options for fully furnished housing (my budget is $2000/month)"

kr0bfp,4yv6oj2q,Digital Nomad financial careers,"Hello all, 

I have seen this thread before, but wanted to get an updated view of the industry given covid, WFH etc. I feel finance has not been the easiest field in which to adopt the digital nomad lifestyle. Do people see different areas of the industry potentially adopting a  more WFH set up? Personally, I work for a large commercial real estate debt lender and they have been pushing us back to office. Have others had more flexibility or been able to start the transition to the nomad lifestyle? Do you see the ability to adopt the lifestyle in other sectors of the industry. I understand in more group/team oriented workplaces it may be tough to work in different time zones, but perhaps careers that do not require hourly communications with your team will have been able to adopt this, although I can not think of too many roles in finance that fit the bill. 

&#x200B;

kr1qft,70bhnimq,The eternal problem with changing phone numbers,"Hello nomads!

I got tired of changing phone numbers for sensitive services like banks and messengers.  I asked some companies that provide virtual numbers what can I do in the digital nomad situation, but it turned out that those numbers don't guarantee that they will work for banks and etc. 

I thought I could easily buy one number, remotely register it with id verification and all, and then assign my email to the number (to receive SMS) and keep paying for it, and never insert any SIM card into my phone. But no! I have to change the phone number for all services on the new phone number of the country I currently in. Or am I missing something? Would be interesting to hear the community's use-cases, how you survive in that sim card flow.

ktajyg,ajivd9j,"How did you figure out the legality of residing in a foreign country for longer than a year, while working for a US company?","Hey all, I'm a US citizen and work for a large, US-based software company that employs tens of thousands of people. 

My partner and I are looking to temporarily move to South Africa later this year, and to stay in SA for about two years (she's a citizen of SA, I'm not). I'd love to keep my current job \[1\], if possible, as I generally enjoy what I do. 

I've been trying to dig up answers around what's the best approach to make this work: **how do I remain in my current position while being in the good graces of my employer and the US government?**   

My company *does not* have any sort of office or legal entity in South Africa, so it's not possible to ""transfer"" there. As such, I see two potential avenues: 

* Under the radar: 
   * I don't tell my employer (besides my direct manager) that I'm in SA \[2\]. My home address remains registered in the US with my employer. But, how would this impact US taxes? Could I be viewed as a ""perpetual tourist"" in the eyes of the US who just loves to vacation in SA, and therefore only pay US taxes? Could I stretch this ""tourist"" schtick for two years?
* Follow rules and regulations:
   * I somehow try to inform my HR department that I'd like to live in SA for two years and look into foreign stays for US tax purposes. TBH, I don't really know how any of this works yet, and I'm somewhat afraid of exposing myself to my company for risk of any blowback. It's also very  possible that my employer's legal team / HR folks wouldn't agree with having someone based in SA.
* Look into a company that's properly remote: 
   * For those that are in the software industry, a company like [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/) comes to mind. They're 100% remote-friendly with folks dispersed through the world. That said, I'd probably be paid in local SA currency, which isn't as ideal. Again, I'm not sure how this works for US taxes.  

&#x200B;

I'd really appreciate any direction here. I've been researching but am really not sure which path is correct, or if I haven't thought about an alternative approach. It's easy enough to visit somewhere for a month or so, return home, and then set out again - but staying somewhere for a solid two *years* seems to put me in different territory. 

Thanks!

&#x200B;

\[1\]  More specifically, there were a round of lay-offs earlier this year that specifically targeted some folks in ""non-strategic"" locations, even though they were remote. I'm still mad about it. 

\[2\] I actually lived in South Africa for three months in 2018, and I travelled under a tourist visa. My manager and team at the time were super supportive and even encouraging. But again, two *years* is a different ballgame than three months."
kthirk,w6phx,I'm becoming a nomadic hotel of sorts. I want to create a network of homes and lodges in the country to provide a place outside of the cities to stay and unwind.

I also didn't have particularly tight deadlines at the time. I found programmers had an easier time just putting on earbuds and plugging away on a couch. I have a 16 inch laptop and large headphones + a few external hard drives so even sitting down to get started is a process and requires a bit of desk/table space. I'd say my productivity was reduced by about half while of course my life satisfaction went way up.

Install F-droid app to download Telegram and smsQ apps, you don't even need a Google account on this phone. Create or sign up to a Telegram account. The smsQ app is a Telegram bot that listens to your SMS messages and relays them to your Telegram account. Leave the phone connected to the charger in a friend's house with good local cellphone service. Silence the ringer. Make sure battery management settings don't kill smsQ due it being idle. I looked into virtual phones like Skype, but they flat out don't work with banks, or work with some and not others. The is no getting better reliability in receiving SMS messages than having a physical cellphone. Also I though of using a phone with dual SIMs and getting one with international SMS support.

I just want to blend in, work remotely, and be able to walk around and enjoy a coffee. I'm easy. I don't need nightlife or amazing restaurants. I just need a grocery store and maybe a gym. Currently, I think I'm leaning toward Antigua because its relatively close to where I'm at now in Costa Rica, its beautiful (hobbyist photographer so I love all the cobblestone and colors), seems kind of sleepy, and it should give me the ability to lay low and admire the city by foot. Thoughts? Thanks for any input!

kvua5m,msa6rvv,Help me experience a taste of nomadic life before I'm too told to do so lol,"Background:  41 y/o female, US citizen, no kids, living and working remotely in the US and striving for FI (financial independence) by age 60.  No spouse/kids/pets/car.  I'm in middle management currently grossing \~$125k annually, have been working remotely for a large pharma for 4 years now (7 years total as I used to work on site for them in another state).

I want to travel WAY more; I've been trying to figure out how for what seems like forever.  My ideal situation, at this time, would be to purchase a very cheap home near my mom (lives 4 hours from me) that I can rent out a room in.  That way, I have a permanent US residence\* to come back to whenever I want that is close to her since she is single/aging, and has someone renting a room to offset the cost while I'm gone, because I currently do not have the desire to live abroad full time and prefer to have a place I can return to if I go abroad for say a month and don't like the place, or I need to return home urgently for something with my mom, and that I can come 'home' to during the holidays instead of doing hotels every year which has been the case for like forever.  I'm thinking 6-9 months out of the year abroad would be nice for the first few years. 

I've been at my current company 7 years total.  There will (may) be a very small pension of \~1k/month if I stay til 10 years.  I'm full time/salaried/permanent.  Top place I'd love to consider living first would be London, followed by possibly Lisbon.  I've been talking about living a more nomadic lifestyle for yearrrsss; now that I have been working remotely for a while I would love to put a plan in place to be able to start doing this finally.  I just can't seem to figure out how.  What I mean when I say this is:

1. Does it make sense to follow the plan mentioned above of having a cheap home that I own here as a 'base'?  The few nomadic people I've mentioned this to say I should have no ties to the US in terms of accommodations (they say to sell everything I can and rent everywhere I go), however, I have my reasons for preferring a base as mentioned above.
2. Do I likely need to leave my current job for perhaps, a contracting role with some other company?  My current company has offices all over the world, but I don't necessarily want to be held to working in any of them for a set period of time if I don't have to; I'd rather 'move around as I please'.  My understanding is as a full time permanent salaried employee I can't just move around to wherever I want right now because there are tax/legal implications for my employer.
3. **How would you go about doing this if you were me?**  How would you handle accommodations?  Would you look for another position?  Factors to consider:  I prefer to have a home base to return to that is close to my mother, I prefer to be able to live anywhere I want for as long a period of time that legally allows, I don't want to knowingly break any immigration and/or tax laws, I could potentially take a pay cut but not by much due to my FI goals-I'm not someone who can go abroad and not work as I need the funds fyi.

Would a contracting position in my same industry allow for me to do this?  Any/all thoughts regarding what I've written are appreciated.

I am currently a Nurse and well, a lot of that work involves me staying in one location. I’ve contemplated travel nursing but my speciality is only available in certain locations. I recently found and will apply for an “Electronic Health Record” EHR Analyst position through my workplace.  They’re making the move to a new system and currently have an opening. I think I’d like it and someone from my current unit moved there prior to COVID. My old coworker told me they’ve all gone remote and may stay that way for a while. I was thinking of applying, hopefully getting an offer, working hard, and then asking about staying remote when everyone goes back to normal. Anyone on here do this kind of work? I’ve looked for jobs online and see that quite a few of these are remote? My goal would be to move abroad one day and these jobs seem like they could work with a digital nomad life. I want to know if anyone actually does this. Thanks in advance!"

I've been working from Latin America for a while, disguising my location through a VPN router (GL-iNet router, PIA VPN to Florida). I login to Office 365 on my personal PC, and don't use the company laptop at all.

The router slows down the VPN a bit, so I'd been using the desktop PIA app, since it provides a faster, more consistent connection than the router, and also offers a killswitch function.

I realized after a couple of hours logged in today that the VPN app wasn't running. I was connecting directly from Ecuador. No idea why the app closed and the killswitch didn't prevent connection.

Maybe they won't notice or won't care. Maybe I'll get fired. No big deal either way; this job sucks and I was gonna resign next week anyway, but I wanted to share my anecdote for those who might try something similar.

I’m in a bit of a pickle and could use some help. 

I have a dream to be a digital nomad, but I haven’t yet found the work I can do to make that happen. My goal used to be to establish my business as a spiritual coach and I will complete my PhD in psychology in 2022. However, I’m starting to wonder if this plan is actually feasible. This market is incredibly saturated. 

The focus of my dissertation is on how gender impacts female CEOs, which I plan to leverage into becoming some sort of consultant in the business world...so that’s the long term goal. Great. 

However, it doesn’t help me get to a space where I am making money to build my dream and I’m not entirely sure how I can leverage my current skills/experience to do so. I have an interest in programming, but I’m not looking to spend more money in education at this point. I feel lost and a bit hopeless about my direction. 

So I’d love some thoughts on ways I can apply myself now and see some type of yield. Note that I have consistently sent out my resume and have only been able to find work as a nanny, server and small jobs here and there (pre-COVID)...so it seems my skills do not fit into the current job market. I could be wrong. 

Here is my experience and my skills:

- Writing - it seems like it takes time to build a reputation as a free lance writer though. Am I wrong here? 
- customer service - the competition in this field is incredibly high, not sure if I could find a niche of some sort. 
- hospitality 
- astrology/spiritual counseling 
- working with kids 
- public welfare/service
- online event organizing & hosting
- MA in Organizational/Development (I/O Psychology) 
- creative expression

kxkap1,,Turning location-specific remote jobs into digital nomad jobs?,"I'm currently preparing to start travelling continuously as soon as the whole pandemic situation is under wraps. I'd like to be able to work along the way, and it would be great to continue the work I already do rather than have to find new work.

Currently, I work as an independent contractor with Lionbridge and Appen on a number of different projects, and it's a perfect situation for me. Unfortunately, at least in Lionbridge's case, these jobs are explicitly only allowed to be accessed in my home country. I'd assume these companies would be aware if I was using a VPN or similar software to access them from abroad.
 
However, I have recently had the idea of setting up a remote desktop at my parents' home which I could access from abroad, which would still technically be accessing the jobs from my country. 

I don't know much about the logistics of that, but if some of you are more knowledgeable, do you think it's doable? And if so, first would you recommend it, and second do you have any suggestions of how best to go about it?

I was born in the coutryside, but moved to a big city at 19 to study and then work. 

I am now 27, working for an energy company as chemical plant modelist, basically I do computer simulations of chemical equipment.

Because of the pandemic I was forced to remote work since last february and I demonstrated that my work is perfectly doable by remote. I just need my laptop and a VPN, no loss in productivity at all (I would say an increase..)

Since I do not like the city (expensive, polluted, far for my parents who are getting older) my dream would be to buy a nice house in the beautiful nature of my countryside, instead of buying an overpriced bedroom in the city, and remotely work from there. 

But I really fear to face repercussions if I demand that, mainly because I am a newcomer to that company (been here only for 2 years) and I do now have other job proposals in hand. Plus, the HR of my department is known to be an asshole. 

Consider that I live in Italy, not in the America where the work culture looks to be more ""evolved"". Here, making such a request is not very common, companies still believe that the presence in office is very important. But I really think that my request is reasonable and that it will be positive for the company also.

I want to take a break/leave my life for about 6 months at least, I’m currently in college but im more and more realizing that this isn’t for me, since I already changed my major once. I recently turned 23 and am nowhere near to finishing college and rather close to having a burn out. I dont feel right, stopped talking to my family for over a year even tho im still living at home. Can’t get out of my bed for weeks (more like months) and am just unhappy in general, can’t find any joy in anything. So the idea of leaving my current life in western europe for a couple of months and moving to a little apartment in the Mediterranean my family owns came to my mind. 

The biggest problem that occurs to me is: I need to start making money online without any real skills, 400-600 $/€ would be enough. But not with braindead jobs like surveys or anything. Does anyone know a subreddit to post this in?

In my time off I thought about getting more in touch with the nature ( plants, etc) {subreddit?}

Start working out {subreddit?}

Read a lot of books to improve my mental and physical health and also my knowledge and maybe go into philosophical stuff {subreddit?}

There are so many more things in my head but since im close to burn out I can’t sort them and tend to lose my overview instantly, but I hope u got the idea of what I was trying to say so if anyone knows subreddits that could find, please let me know.

(As someone with ADHD) I'll take challenging over boring any day .

Some background :

I'm 24 , I live in India and currently I'm stuck at a dead end career in banking. What I currently do is glorified data entry , its a monotonous job and with my ADHD, It's killing me. I'm at a point where I'm secretly hoping every night that I don't wake up the next day, just so I don't have to go back to work. The only path for advancement in this career is lower level management , and I don't want to go into that. 

I currently earn 30,000rs or about 400$, and I can live off of 250$ easily. So I'd be satisfied with  that or anything above at the beginning of my freelancing journey. I have lots of ideas for creative and entrepreneurial ventures that I want to explore, and the money I earn from freelancing will support me financially while having more free time and flexibility over my schedule to do all of that.

 It would be a huge bonus if the skill is something that will help me be a better entrepreneur."

Planning on getting a studio Airbnb in Galata or near Taksim square (that's where all the good Airbnbs seem to be) for a month and am probably going to venture out of Istanbul on the weekends to see more of the country. Planning on getting a place with a desk space I can use for work so I can have privacy for work (I will be in a lot zoom meetings and running coding lectures). It seems doable. My questions for anyone experienced with working remotely from Istanbul are:  
1) (important) Is there a place that will rent out a monitor (to attach to my laptop as a second screen) for a month? Trying to have to avoid buying another screen but it's a necessity  
2) What are the workspaces like? Any that particularly stand out? I read it's not a very walkable city so if I do use a work-space, I guess it would have to be something close to where I live  
3) Is there anything wrong with the areas I am planning on staying in (Galata/ by Taksim square)?  
4) Any general pointers or things you wish you knew before heading to Istanbul?  
5) Does anyone have any experience of flying in with a drone exceeding 500g in weight (Mavic air 2 which is 570 g)? I read it might be prohibited to bring anything over 500g into the country without registration (which is limited to Turkish nationals) but I know that customs in a lot of places don't care too much about this. Although some places really do, which is why I am asking"

My interests include music production, web development/app development, digital marketing, chess and maybe drawing. But I don't have a degree and also I'm not an expert on any of these.

In addition to this, I have to restrict my screen time to just 4 hours a day which means I can only work for 2-3hrs. ALSO, I want to do something online/from home with no social interaction at all other than maybe corresponding via email (so no video/phone calls)

l1agdk,8v6t7g80,My Hot Take on Slow Travel.,"I do not remember the first time I heard the term "" Slow Travel ."" I do however remember the response that it evoked which was, ""Well that is fucking stupid.""

As always in a a twist of fate, I have been living the definition of slow travel.....

Who is stupid now? I guess the answer is me...

Slow travel seems to have many different definitions, and also seems to come in many different shapes but this article is about what the term and idea mean to me. When I think about the term it actively describes what I have been doing in the last three months versus what I used to do.

So let us talk about what I have been doing recently. What I have been doing in the last three months is really living in a country. I have been renting AirBnBs for more than a month to save money and also because I did not want the hassle of consistent travel. It is amazing how taxing a day of traveling can be at times, even after just making a domestic flight in Colombia I was noticeably more exhausted the following day. It sounds a little silly, but I totally noticed a difference. To avoid that, and get the discount that hosts usually offer on longterm rentals (exceeding 28 days) I have been making our stays an average of five weeks.

So somewhat unintentionally I have fallen in the slow travel category. What that means to me is that you stay in a place longer, often with the intention to get a better connection and appreciation for the surroundings. I have to say that I can really say that there is truth to this. I do not feel stress to see everything in a short amount of time. I often explore neighborhoods while running. I try foods from street vendors because I am not worried about one night of an upset stomach that would usually mean that a day of my precious time in the country is wasted. It allows me to grocery shop and not eat out for every meal as it makes sense to buy food and cook.

All of this just feeds into what I like to do while traveling. While I enjoy tourist attractions, what I enjoy most is just walking around, exploring, and feeling like I really ""lived"" there. For me that is when I grocery shop, buy coffees from a street cart, and have a beer at the corner store. In my case for South America, this also means speaking and practicing Spanish instead of attempting to speak English. It also means knowing where the grocery store is, which corner store is open late in case I need beer in a pinch, which place serves our favorite food, and so on and so forth. It means feeling like I live somewhere, that when I cook dinner at night I do it in the ""comfort"" of my own home, because that is usually how I come to feel about a place once I have been there for a month.

This experience of living, stands in stark contrast with the usual travel I used to do whether it was for work or for pleasure. When I traveled as a project manager I would be staying in a hotel, working most days and eating out for every meal. I am grateful that most of my projects were about two weeks in length which allowed me a few days off during that time to explore and really do something. This was a huge luxury, as it did not force me to try to cram in exploring before or after work and meant that even if it was just for my off days I was essentially able to have a vacation paid for by my employer. The per diem was generous so I always had plenty of opportunities to eat and drink more than was strictly necessary and try cool new foods or restaurants. I am incredibly grateful to have had this opportunity. But all of this was still closer to your normal tourist, sight-seeing experience I would have on my vacations. Usually they involved working until the last minute, flying somewhere in a different time zone, and then keeping busy with tourist stuff. This often left me feeling like I needed a vacation, from my vacation when I came home. For example last time I went to Spain, we were gone for about two weeks and went to Barcelona, Madrid, Ibiza, and Lisbon. That was just too much to really enjoy a place before moving on to the next one.

That experience of really living somewhere short term, instead of feeling like a tourist is what slow travel means to me. That is what I have been fully embracing the last couple months while I have been abroad. I hope that you too at some point have the opportunity to experience a place like this. Additionally, the realization that I will likely not be able to see everything in the world that I want to see has helped to ease the mental stress I would sometimes place upon my self to always keep busy instead of relaxing when my body tells me to relax. Even if you do not have the chance to go somewhere for an extended period of time, make sure that instead of jamming the most into the shortest time; go for a walk and have a beer at the corner store while sitting in a plastic chair, sit and read a book at that cute coffee shop, or take a nap in the park. I think you will thank me."

l1v2im,101wsk,"Reminder: being a digital nomad is technically illegal but not pursued, so don't abuse it.","Following the Kristen Gray incident, a quick reminder.

&#x200B;

\- If you work in a country, you need to have a work permit, that includes working online.

\- In most countries you are tax liable even if you work online/for a company abroad/get paid abroad, because they apply the locally sourced rule: if your income is generated within their territory (usually that means you're physically in it, but it could also be that your facilities are located there), then you owe taxes there.

\- You become tax resident in most countries if you stay there more than 6 months a year.

&#x200B;

However, many countries popular with digital nomads will ignore this. Most likely they realize that if they made this harder the digital nomads will just go somewhere else. Also enforcing this might be more work than it's worth it to them.

Generally these governments will only enforce these laws if you give them a reason to do so, usually by drawing too much attention (as Kirsten Gray did) or going too far (begpackers, Chinese online casino's in Thailand)."

I need a setup where I can work from different locations outside the US but have my work device show a US IP address. I’ll need to connect to the company VPN so any solution would have a double VPN, I imagine.

I’m thinking that I could setup up a router with a VPN and then connect that to whatever router I have access to wherever I am (yes, I’m aware I’d need router admin access).

l2r2yb,,What American bank is best for travel?,"I’ve been using Simple bank. I could leave an opinion about them, but it would be moot *since they are shutting down*.

Hence my predicament and this post.

Some of what I consider to be good aspects of a bank fit for traveling:

Good customer service, ideally 24/7 but simple didn’t have that so I can work with it.

Responsiveness - being able to enable/disable access to cards quickly and reliably (simple was mostly good, had horrible problems in Ukraine though) and by country (let my card work in Poland for two weeks, anything outside of that time frame is fraudulent)

Protections - for example, set a daily spending limit in case a card gets lost or stolen, giving me time to cancel a card and limit my losses (if I try to spend a thousand dollars a day, that’s fraudulent)

Coverage - access to my account in a high number of countries (see above re: Ukraine. I was probably the first and only customer to try and use my card there)

Good online banking - being able to most things day-to-day banking without involving customer service.

Note - most of my travel had been in central/Eastern Europe, but I’m leaning towards central and South America for my next leg. Global coverage would be ideal though.

I’m totally open to non-American based banks - it’s just that it can be very difficult to open one as a non-resident (example raiffeisen bank was everywhere in Europe, but I couldn’t open an account despite my best efforts - I’ll spare you the details)

Thoughts? What’s working best for you?"

I need your advice on Mexico again. Before anyone says it: I know the places mentioned in the title are all different and can't really be copared, but I'd still love to hear advice.

I want to spend the next few weeks or possibly up to 2-3 months somewhere in Mexico (I was in Playa and will eventually go back I think, but I want to see more places) and I just can't make up my mind. These are the places I'm considering (haven't been to either yet):

1. Puerto Vallarta (or Sayulita- Not sure what's better)
2. San Cristobal de Casas
3. Oaxaca

First I was pretty set on PV as I like warm weather and beaches AND mountains, plus expat community seems good, but I've realized that it seems quite expensive rent-wise (Airbnbs/short term) and that maybe it's too spread out or too touristy. I find San Cristobal interesting because Chiapas sounds amazing nature-wise, and Oaxaca's climate seems good, it seems cheap and close-ish to beach places for weekend getaways.
I'm eventually gonna go to all of these but I gotta make up my min where to go first.

I'd like to get started with affiliate marketing, but to be honest, I have absolutely no clue where and how to start. I could really use some guidance in the beginning. Therefore, I was thinking about buying an online course which is supposed to teach that stuff. Since I'm naturally rather skeptical though, I have a feeling that most courses online are actually scams, even if the person behind it seems knowledgeable and trustworthy. Now I think an important factor is the price of a course. If it's free or rather cheap, I doubt that it'll be of high quality, since putting together a quality course certainly consumes a lot of time to get it made. Therefore, rather expensive courses have a higher probability of being legit, at least that's my guess. What do you think about that though?

I started selling stuff, and I am having second thoughts. It is so scary for me, but I know it is for the better.

I want to explore living in another country and possibly find a new place to relocate for the following reason: 

* In my country, we are not allowed to own accounts in currency and the money has to be converted to the local currency and when we travel the government allows us to only take the equivalent of $2200 per year.
* There are not enough green spaces and parks to walk in and as someone who works from home in front of a computer, it is important for me to go for walks ( I could move to a new house near a park, but it is not that easy to find here)
* The political and economic situation is terrible, but as a freelancer who works for foreign companies I am not impacted by it a lot but still, things are very expensive, a lot more expensive than countries like Turkey, Malaysia, Thailand, etc.. 
* I have always wanted to leave the country.
* I already visited every corner of this country (Tunisia) and I know it too well, it is not as exciting as before for me. 
* Ordering food is very limited and of poor quality and very unhealthy unless you pay a fortune and as someone who is very busy with work, I need access to healthy affordable food that is ready 
* I can go on a proper vacation since things are expensive here, and if I travel I have to quarantine in a hotel for a week.
* Access to attractions, events and activities that are not available here. 
* Access to books ( very limited here especially English books) 
* The possibility of creating an online business with access to a better banking system ( banks suck here) 

These are some of the reasons for why I want to sell everything and leave. I am however feeling scared as this is a big change for me and I don't like change. What if I regret it? I won't be able to get back the comfort that I am having from this familiarity around me. My desk, my sofas, my bed, my fridge.    
I want to leave more than anything, but I have found happiness in the little things that shape my daily life. I made a home, and now I have to give it away for something that I know will be worth trying for, yet I am scared."

When the COVID situation improves, I'd like to spend several months each in a Spanish- and Portuguese- speaking city in South America, improving my skills with both languages and experiencing local culture, nightlife, and landscapes. For what it's worth, I speak intermediate Spanish and survival tier Portuguese. I'm more enthusiastic about arts, culture, history, and nightlife than the great outdoors or sporty activities, though I really do love the beach.

I've travelled around Latin America before (though not in South America) and have done enough research into these five cities to get a general impression of the lifestyle each offers. Though I'd really like to hear from people who've spent time in each of these places - what you liked, what you didn't, what the infrastructure is like for working remotely, anything you think is important to know or plan around before going there.

Any and all thoughts you have on these destinations are most welcome, and hopefully this thread'll be useful for anyone considering these cities in the future. Some thoughts to steer the conversation:

Medellín: Seems to have risen as a ""nomad hub"" of sorts over the past few years, up there with Mexico City for popularity. Though Medellín is much smaller, many of the destination reports I've read focus on one neighbourhood (El Poblado, sometimes Laureles), and that makes me wonder about the dynamic of living in the city. Does the security situation in Medellín nosedive outside of one or two areas? Is it easy to integrate and make local friends too or is the nomad community largely in a bubble?

Buenos Aires: Has long had a reputation for being relatively safe compared to cities in the likes of Brazil and Colombia, though I'm concerned that the double whammy of COVID and economic turbulence has made BA more dangerous. Has life in the city become less secure lately? 

Rio: Probably has my ideal combo of urban culture + lively nightlife + beaches, at the cost of being the most expensive and most dangerous. Is it too great a risk here to bring laptops out in the open and work from cafes? Any thoughts on the co-working scene? How does the quality of life in Floripa compare?

Thanks!"

l9a3we,118dbw,Are Macbooks not robust machines for digital nomads?,"I'm looking for comments from Macbook users, horror stories preferred. I think Macbooks are probably pretty popular among the nomad crowd, especially coders.

Most of the time my laptop is in a backpack strapped to a motorcycle, getting bumped around and squashed. 

I've never used a Macbook before.

The one thing I can't get past on the Macbook M1 is the soldered SSD. Has anyone had problems with Macbooks and can comment on the data integrity risks? And how robust are Macbooks towards physical damage and water ingress?

I see the integrated SSD as a big risk, especially if you live and travel to countries without official Apple support locations anywhere. I'm currently in Laos and a Macbook repair will probably take a month.

If anything happens to the Macbook, like if for some reason it can't turn on, the screen doesn't work, it turns on but turns off quickly afterwards, etc. your data is essentially locked to the device. You can't open the computer and take out the SSD and get your data back. There's only so much that cloud backups can do.

And when someone from Apple ""repairs"" the Macbook, likely by swapping out the entire main board with a working one, can your data on the mainboard even get copied over? Or are you forced to go to a specialty shop that will actually take the time to actually repair the board by replacing individual surface mounted components?"

The other day I was speaking with a friend who is interested in the DN lifestyle and when he asked what jobs are best for the nomadic lifestyle, I really didn’t know what to say other than, “you know, stuff with computers.”

So now I’m trying to compile a little list of DN-friendly jobs and web sites or courses he can take to learn the skills to land a job. He’s not opposed to paying for a course to learn new skills, as he learns well in a structured setting. I know drop shipping was popular at one time, but is that still profitable? He realizes he’ll have to invest time to learn and then put in more time finding work before he can embark on his journey. He seems to have realistic expectations about everything.

So what are the “Holy Grail” jobs of the digital nomad lifestyle? And what is the best way to learn how to do these jobs?

The holy grail of DN jobs would be ones that:

-	Can be worked remotely from anywhere in the world.
-	Do not have set hours.
-	Require very little interaction with clients, team members or bosses.
-	Are in high demand.
-	Pay a high hourly rate
-	Project-based so you can accept/decline projects as you see fit based around your schedule.

lashz4,3dq5opdm,"Did you get hired for a remote contract one day, and got it terminated the next day, ever?","I recently interviewed for a web dev position with a company based in Europe.  
I myself am based in South Asia.

Yesterday was my first day with this client, and today, well, was the last.

I will give a brief rundown of what exactly happened, and I am basically looking for relevant feedback, i.e. is this kind of thing common when trying to work remotely.

I have working as a digital nomad (DN) for about 2 years now as a web developer. I recently decided to look for more work, and so in the searching process, I stumbled across an opening offering a 'full-time' contract. I applied. I was given a test. There was no interview, or any communication except over text/email only.

I passed the test, I got offered a contract. The contract had some interesting things like 'you cannot expect privacy on the machine you work', and other things along those lines. I didn't pay much heed to it as my work machine is separate from my personal machine anyway. They would use time tracking software which would record everything you do on your machine during work hours.

This contract also required me to be present in the work hours based on where the company is located (8am - 5pm). I guessed that was pretty standard as well for a 'full-time' contract. All my previous contracts had been of a different nature, i.e. I was never required to be present for a full 8-9 hours. I do attend regularly scheduled meetings to discuss updates and other things, but those meeting rarely cross the hour mark.

I sign the contract, I haven't talked to anyone at the company in any shape or form except over email/text. Then comes yesterday, my first day. I am given a vague set of instructions. This company build it's own internal tools using a widely known web framework. Unfortunately, their documentation was close to non-existent, which made completing my assigned tasks quite difficult. I am by no means a super-genius expert within my domain, but I have more than a couple years of experience, and I manage to get by pretty well.

The first day comes to a close, I clock in 8 hours, I only manage to get half the assigned tasks done. I inform my 'supervisor' about the difficulties I ran into and I tell him I will continue working on them tomorrow. He guides me to another resource which could help make my task easier, and tells me I haven't completed my tasks, and implies I should continue working beyond the 8 hour mark. I politely tell him I have other commitments to tend to, and if possible, I will try to get some more work in before the next day.

The next day comes around. My 'supervisor' asks me why didn't I clock in extra hours yesterday. I told him I was busy elsewhere, and I had already clocked in 8 hours for the day. He says I didn't complete all my tasks, so I should have stayed back. I told him the vagueness of his instructions and the lack of documentation regarding the internal tools proved to be serious obstacles. He accuses me of trying to get away with doing the bare minimum, when in reality, I did try my best to get the assigned tasks complete.

By this point, I already had half a mind to terminate the contract, but I was willing to treat this as a challenge or a hurdle to overcome.

When I mentioned the point about the lack of documentation and vague instructions, the 'supervisor' responds with 'take care and don't apply again'. Then he closes down the chat group we were part of.

This was the first time I experienced something of this sort. I have been and still do work with other clients where we have a smooth working partnership. But this particular event was something.

I guess part of the reason I am writing this is to vent, but I am genuinely interested in hearing if there are other folks here who have had similar experiences, and if yes, how did you handle them. Did you take any steps or precautions to further prevent such occurrences?

I already have a job, earning about 2k U$S a month, with the possibility of negotiating up to 2.5k if I migrate to another country. 

So far I found three options that may be suitable for me:

- [Remotely from Georgia](https://agenda.ge/en/news/2020/2654): a one-year visa to work in Georgia. 
- [Czech Long-Term Visa](https://www.mzv.cz/jnp/en/information_for_aliens/long_stay_visa/long_stay_visa.html): similar to the previous one, a one-year visa to work in the Czech republic.

Of those, the one that interests me the most is Spain's Non-Lucrative Residence Visa. The reason is, that my end goal is to settle down in the Basque Country. However, as far I understand, I would have to resign from my job if I apply for this visa.

I have enough saved up to survive a year, maybe two without working, but what after the money runs out? 

So, my question is: are there any other alternatives? Did anyone move to EU with a remote job without an EU/US passport?

My issues are the following:  I have a big German Shepherd meaning I would need some kind of fenced in yard.  We would love to have a private pool or hot tub (seeing as we are both homebodies we want a great home).  Should I fly? Should I drive? Dollar per dollar it seems the same but if I drove I could take more stuff and have a vehicle but if I fly I can shorten my trip while avoiding border towns (which worry me less if I take my GS dog).  If flying when should I buy tickets?

Is AirBNB the best place to find houses?  Should I agree to a longer commitment rental or inspect it first? Should I be looking in Mexico City?  Wifi is the number one priority for us as without it I cannot work.  I speak fairly good Spanish and she is ok but we are looking to improve our Spanish as it is so Spanish as the local language is ok.  What should my time table be for committing to a rental?   

&#x200B;

Any advice would be appreciated, feel free to add more tips than just what I asked.  Thanks so much!

lfkesn,,DigitalNomads of Playa Del Carmen: How often do you have internet or electrical outages?,"Hello.  I'm a full-time Software Engineer and I work 100% remotely.

Recently when I mentioned to my boss I was considering moving, my boss mentioned ""Just make sure you put work first, such that you are never in a place where you lack internet.  We need you at work when you're supposed to be at work.""  Which, I totally understand-- I am paid to do a job, so I must be able to do that job.

Rather than paying $1000-$1200 for rent in a city in the US, I am considering moving to Playa Del Carmen, where I've seen decent one bedroom places for approximately $300-$400 per month.

I am tempted to move there, but I just want to make sure that it's unlikely or rare that I would have an  internet or electrical outage.

Thus, intrepid Digital Nomads of Playa Del Carmen, I ask for your help in answering my question:

\- How often do you have internet or electrical outages?

\- Have you had any in the last 6 months?  If so, how many, for how much time were you disconnected, and were you able to find connectivity at a nearby locations (for example, within a few city blocks at a cafe)?

I spent about 2 months in Tulum last year and noticed: 1. slow internet such that I had to turn off my computer's webcam during zoom calls and 2. occasional outages (once every couple weeks), sometimes electrical (and therefore internet) outages lasting 1-2 days, which effected the entire city (I was living in Tulum city proper).

I think Albania is one of the best options in the world right now for  digital nomads and expats who want to live in warm and sunny southern Europe, which is why I moved here.  Fast internet, inexpensive apartments (always with an enormous balcony), a huge Mediterranean coast with crystal clear waters, friendly locals, gorgeous nature (beaches, mountains and forests), and in southern Europe (near Greece and Italy). 

And no visa issues! At least three-months visa free, no costs, no pre-arranged e-visa needed. Americans can come any time and stay for one year (one year!) visa free with no border runs, no fees. Everything here (except electronics) is 70% cheaper than USA.  If you decide to stay longer than a year the Albanian government is now taking steps to make the residency process easy.

lh3bnp,3tfdnb33,Advice: How to Best Develop Myself for Abroad Marketing Career,"My SO and I are planning on moving abroad in 2022 (US origin) and traveling for 2 years moving around to various countries across 4 continents and I'm looking for job advice. My first step will be to ask my current employer about remote opportunities but I am 102% positive that will be a dead end. I have various skills and I have the time & curiosity to develop new skills before we leave.

Right now, my thoughts are to move into either graphic design (would need to learn) or website development (I have minor coding experience but I'm confident I would be good at this) so I could do freelance work but choosing something is so overwhelming (will it pay enough, will I work too much, etc). I'm looking for advice from those of you who went through the same WTF DO I DO ABROAD kind of moment or have had a good/bad experience with a marketing job you have/had abroad.

About me: 26F with 4+ years in marketing. 1.5 years focused on customer retention marketing, 1.5 years on email marketing, and now 1.5 years at a startup doing all customer marketing (email marketing, SMS, blog development (have copywriter), social media (I do strategy), reviews, website content (have an agency to code), referral program, light advertising, some content creation on my own. I'm a fairly 'technical' marketer (very analytically minded) and have light experience in SQL/HTML and familiarity with postman JSON, etc to use Zapier to make API calls. I take anything new that's thrown at me, I love challenges. 

Some main nomad interests: website development, graphic design, photography, copywriting, email coding but open to anything!

Other Requirements: 

\-Worldwide/time-zones friendly (we'll be moving around)

\-30-40 hour flexible weeks (want to be able to take 3-day weekends without always having to worry about PTO)

\-Reasonable salary, I currently make 90 base salary & have \~10K in benefits, willing to take a pay cut since I'll work less but would love not to (I'm not trying to screw up my financial goals just to travel)"

>In a series of tweets at the weekend, Kristen Gray wrote about the perks  of her decision to move to the tropical island of Bali with her  girlfriend, describing it as the “perfect medicine”, a place that was  LGBT friendly, and where the low cost of living afforded her a luxurious  lifestyle.  
>  
>... Gray’s tweets were slammed by many Indonesians on social media for  various reasons, including allegations she may have cheated the system  by dodging taxes, exploited Western privilege, and for an apparent lack  of awareness about Indonesian society.  
>  
>After Gray  was summoned for questioning on Tuesday, I Putu Surya Dharma, a  spokesman for Bali’s Law and Human Rights agency, told Reuters the U.S.  citizen would be deported as soon as a flight was available, and was  currently being held at an immigration detention facility.  
>  
>In  a statement on its website, the immigration office said Gray may have  violated several immigration laws, including by spreading information  that could disturb the public, such as suggesting that Bali was “queer  friendly” and easily accessible to foreigners amid the COVID-19  pandemic.  
>  
>“Hi  everyone, first of all I’m not guilty, I have not overstayed my visa, I  have not made money in Indonesian rupiah in Indonesia. I put out a  statement about LGBT, and I’ve been deported because I’m LGBT,” Gray  told reporters.

I share this as a reminder of something that might not be obvious to people who are starting their DN journey and haven't spent much time in countries with different political and cultural norms: **not everywhere is like home**. There's a lot of discussion these days about ""free speech"" in Western countries and where its limits lie, but whatever your opinion, don't forget that many non-Western countries take a much more restrictive view on free speech than anything you might think is reasonable.

To be clear, I don't think this woman deserved to be deported and the story reflects poorly on Indonesia. But this isn't a question of what's right, it's a question of practical reality. **Be careful what you say on social media**, and don't underestimate how much attention the authorities may be paying - especially in authoritarian countries with limited press freedom.  

Does anyone have any experience with this kind of thing, or know someone who does? A pretty common story I've heard in Thailand is of people saying disrespectful things about the king, which is a HUGE no-no, and getting deported when the wrong person overhears it. I'm sure there are other ""obvious"" not-to-dos in many countries that aren't actually obvious to a new arrival. What should I be aware of?"

But I'm also in the process of learning programming to switch careers to land a junior dev fullstack javascript position later this year (side-note: I attended a bootcamp two years ago then stepped away from programming until about 2 months ago, so much of this studying is review). Hard to estimate how far away I am from being hirable at a company for that, but I would think 5-7 months or so as long as I stay disciplined.

Anyway, rather than study here in my house 4-5 hours a day, I'd rather do it 4-5 hours a day from a beach in Thailand or a cafe in the Balkans, though I'm sure those 4-5 hours out there would have a lot more distraction.

It seems that the laws have changed since my friend got his a few years ago and that it’s no longer possible to rely on income earned by freelancing to fulfill the income requirement of a non-lucrative visa.

I was told that it may be possible to rely on my 401k and any savings as the basis for the financial requirement but I would be committing to not working.  Also, was told that the local consulate only grants work visas for self-employed individuals / autonomos very rarely and that my best bet would be to opt for a non-lucrative visa then try for a modification after a year if I want.  

The thing is, I have plenty of work and I have a consistent record to prove that fact.  Most of my clients are here in the US and I have one in Europe.  I’m quite a ways away from actual “retirement.”  It would seem somewhat odd if I theoretically apply for visa, under the premise that I’m not working (non-lucrative), only to apply for a freelancer type visa a year later with records to prove that I actually have income from working (after I said that I wouldn’t?).  That sounds like I would be getting myself some trouble.  What this lawyer is suggesting sounds a bit questionable so I thought I would get some thoughts here.  Her fee is 3000/USD and makes no promises for helping with documentation and the submission process.  She’s told me my best bet is to go for the non-lucrative visa and then apply to modify it a year down the road when it comes up for renewal.

Is it true that the autonomo visa is now in-fact near impossible to get for Spain?  Could anyone share their experience and any advice for someone who’s doing just fine running a freelance data science consulting and training business looking to get a visa in Spain?

They claimed that the working paradigm I am hunting is technically illegal and to work in the UK I must be based there. From watching the video I am unconvinced, it seems to simply highlight some potential problems, most of which can be avoided or mitigitated (double tax treaties, health/travel insurance etc..)

lko2r4,16wg9w,Lost but want out!,"Hi

I am 34yo, have worked 10 years in high demanding tech/finance companies (both startups and large companies) as a software engineer. For the most part, I didn’t enjoy the corporate world. My last stint is particularly grueling, I work 70 hours a week in a fire dumpster and am severely burned out.

Reflecting more deeply on my experience, the root of all issues is that I didn’t like any of my bosses, and I’ve had several. The feeling of being owned, constantly pushed and pressured to deliver for irrelevant deadlines, and having to take orders is just something not in my nature. I also dislike a static office life.

I just need to figure out what to do next. If I close my eyes and dream, I see myself having a solo online business (not consultancy though) that I can conduct while living a slow-travel lifestyle around the world, staying in one or two places a year. But, having been a corporate soldier my whole life, I have become so conditioned to being just a highly functioning cog in a big machine, that I have no idea what I could do. 

I live frugally at $40k a year in Chicago, and through diligent savings I have $3M in index funds.

Any idea or advice would be appreciated."

ll2e4b,,Finding a remote job to support myself through university,"Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I would like to ask for some advice on how to find a way to make my (limited) skillset profitable. I just turned 23 years old (both EU and Argentine citizen) and I really feel like finally starting university, either a 4 year nursing or psychology  degree, after having worked around the globe (Argentina, Europe & Australia) for the last 5 years.

Unfortunately, the jobs that I did don't translate very well to the DN lifestyle/remote positions, since I worked mainly as a receptionist in hotels/hostels. I do currently work as a Customer service agent for a holiday home rental website and I'm able to do it from home, due to the pandemic.

My strong suit is that I'm fully bilingual in Spanish and English and that I speak French and Italian fluently. Along with my customer service/ hospitality experience, I feel like my only option would be to look for CS roles. I am fairly tech savvy but I don't have any certifications nor specific training that would make me specially suitable for tech support or more tech oriented roles.

Ideally (being fully aware that I'm asking too much), I would like to work towards a job or business that would allow me to work part time (30 hours or less, due to not being the most efficient student and probably needing a lot of study time) without needing to make all that much money. Sure, the more the merrier, but realistically I could get away with making 700€ a month while living in Europe or even 300€ in Argentina.

Do you guys have any advice that could steer me in the right direction? Anyone worked/is working towards a similar project?

In addition,  would it be worth it or even necessary for me to get more specific and relevant skills such as learning a programming language or similar in order to be able to find jobs?

Thank you all for your time and help, everything counts :)"
lldnxq,9nxihu5r,Remote Working In The Legal Field,"Greetings everyone! Hope everyone is safe and healthy!

If this is not the appropriate place to submit this question, please let me know! 

I am a recent college student and I will graduate in May 2021 and plan to go to law school next year. I am very excited and look forward to entering the legal field as a professional. While I was attending a pre-law class, our professor had a guest speaker who was a lawyer and she gave us a brief highlight of her career. During the conclusion of her talk, she briefly mentioned that she worked remotely while she traveled to Europe for about 2-3 weeks.

That really got me thinking about remote working in the legal field. Unlike most of my peers, I kind of enjoy the online/remote version of learning. Likewise, I love the idea of having a remote, asynchronous job in the legal field. There are quite a few reasons I love the idea of remote working. You can work from home or while you travel, spend more time with your family/loved one, and the hassle of the commute is taken out. Most importantly, it gives you freedom of movement and flexibility.

The pandemic pushed remote-working into the spotlight and that too in an extreme way. One of the things the COVID19 pandemic has proven is that many fields of work can effectively be moved online and done remotely. There has been a surge in companies such as [Facebook](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/5/21/21266570/facebook-remote-work-from-home-mark-zuckerberg-twitter-covid-19-coronavirus), [Spotify](https://online-insider.com/index.php/2021/02/14/spotify-joins-top-tech-company-to-work-from-anywhere/), [Google](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/23/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-considering-hybrid-work-from-home-models.html), [Salesforce](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Salesforce-to-allow-permanent-remote-work-for-15937086.php), [Twitter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/01/twitter-work-from-home/?arc404=true), [Microsoft](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21508964/microsoft-remote-work-from-home-covid-19-coronavirus) who are moving to a permanent work from home or some kind of hybrid format for their employees. It would be appropriate to assume that law firms and other legal institutions will make a switch to remote-working or hybrid format in some capacity.

The nature of the legal field is well suited for the online format. To what degree are these remote-jobs asynchronous or synchronous? I ask this because as mentioned before I want to travel the world and it would be an absolute pain to have to try to match different time zones when you are halfway across the globe. Is it possible to work for a firm, prove your skills to them, and then later negotiating with them into converting it into a remote format? If anyone here has any recent experience working remotely or any general knowledge about it, I would love to hear about it. I would love to see through your perspective, as I really want to get a better idea about this.  Any sort of information or feedback is highly appreciated!

**TL;DR:** As a professional and for my career in the legal field, I want to have an asynchronous remote job.

Stay safe, stay healthy and wear a mask! Thank you! (Y)

I'm considering renting long term, but another idea is to buy a car.

Imagine you buy a car on your favorite continent. Rent an apartment for a couple months, then when you grow bored of the place, you throw all of your stuff in the car and drive a thousand kilometers to your next destination, where you stay another couple months. Repeat ad nauseam. This essentially solves the transportation issue. If you want to go to another continent for a couple months, you can just throw all of your stuff in the car and park it somewhere for the duration.

Different form what vanlife people do, you wouldn't actually live in the car, but simply use it as a tool to move stuff (and yourself) around a couple times a year, or however much you like.

lokl9y,ym51n,Portable Wifi SERVER? (Not just a hotspot),"Hello,

I'm interested in purchasing a portable wifi server - like the Unlimited IRL Backpack and Imcon Intl. Backpack. I know these vary in price, but I'm seeing a huge range of $3,000 up to $8,000, and I'm struggling to understand the disparity.

From what I can tell, the Imcon backpacks are more expensive than Unlimited IRL simply because they offers satellite connection instead of just cellular bonding. I've also seen individual builds of IRL streaming backpacks for around $2000, which sounds great, but I'm unsure if these personal builds have the capacity to connect without cell service. 

I'm not too keen on this area, but I believe all I'm after is some type of portable device that will provide wifi both with and without cell service, bouncing off of satellites only when necessary. I don't need it to be able to handle live streaming, or even come in the form of a backpack, just a device that can handle basic wifi use for 4-6 people in remote areas of the world.

**Questions:**

Have any of you ever used either of these products listed, or anything similar? Preferably, anything cheaper than $8k that offers satellite connection when needed?

Is it possible to simply purchase a wifi server that can connect via satellite, without the backpack nonsense? Maybe I'm looking for something easy like a Starlink satellite + portable battery pack, and I'm just over thinking it? I know Starlink isn't available everywhere yet, but for the next four years this device would actually only be used in areas where it *is* available, so i'm open to considering it.

I do obviously everything online, but I need a US address to receive new credit cards, IRS correspondence, list it on my driver license, and use it with my brokerage and bank account. I need to be able to prove it’s a residential address where I could live. 

Most virtual mailbox services I see just offer a mail forwarding service on a business address, meaning it would be impossible to get a driving license and/or the kind of documentation that a bank or brokerage account might ask (e.g. lease agreement). For example, I moved last summer within the US and upon changing my address my Vanguard brokerage asked me for proof of residence. I couldn’t afford my account to be locked or terminated while I’m abroad. 

Is there any reliable service that provides you with a residential address and a residential leasing agreement, alongside a typical mail forward/scanning service?

I know most people end up relying on parents or family, but I don’t have that luxury, I’m literally alone with my girlfriend in the US, and I’m a renter."
lq7hok,bmskt,Technical Writing or Web Dev?,"Would it be better to get into Technical Writing or Web Development with hopes of becoming a digital nomad? I currently have a Bachelor's in English with no experience in computer science, tech, or coding, however I plan on getting a certificate in whichever profession I choose to get me started. 

Technical writing seems like a good option because of my education in writing and creative side but I am worried it would not be as easy to find remote Technical writing jobs. Is this true? Are there many remote technical writers? 

I'm considering web development because remote workers seem to be common, paid decently, and not have as hard of a time finding work. However with zero experience with coding I'd be starting from scratch and I'm unsure if I'd be passionate enough about tech to handle working as a developer. 

Thank you!"

lqhs6l,8v6t7g80,How to become a digital nomad,"The question of ""How"", is one that I get asked and see being asked very often. Therefore I wanted to take the time to write something up that explains my experience with the process.  
The first way to become a digital nomad is easy, you can do exactly what I did. Just quit your job.  
Okay, there was definitely more to it than that. I had toyed with the idea for a long time, and once Covid hit and I was no longer able to work the job I loved and my best friend got the okay from his company to work remotely. He then proceeded to ""pressure"" me to quit my job, or at least that is how I am telling the story.   
 I feel truly blessed to have been able to save so that I am now able to take time off and travel, while job searching from beautiful Colombia. The other shoutout here should go to my parents who have always said they would be willing to take me back in case this adventure does not work out. That type of safety net has made many decisions much easier on me.

Here is probably the real reason, you clicked to read post because you are still employed and are trying to convince your employer to let you start working remotely. I believe that Covid has pushed a lot of workplaces in the direction of allowing remote work as a serious alternative to working in the office. Below you will find an outline, by my friend Sam, of what he did step by step.  
§ Prework   
o Start with informal conversations with your supervisor to get buy in and expose them to the idea, come up with ideas of what it means to you and show excitement about the prospects  
o Build trust with your manager and demonstrate strong communication skills  
o Be a high performer  
o Figure out if your company has HR policies already in place for this  
§ Formalize the process  
o When you start to formalize the conversations make sure you have a plan. The more 	thought you put into the plan the easier your time will be.  
o Start with a modest proposal, like a three-six month trial period for example  
o Make sure there are no legal/tax issues for the company (i.e. maintain address)  
o Work does not get interrupted  
§ Logistics  
o Keep same working hours   
o Work setup for productivity   
o Redundant internet sources. Only stay places with fast internet access.  
o How you will communicate with your team and boss  
§ IT  
o Confirm with company IT you will be able to access everything (VPN etc)  
o What happens if you have computer issues   
o Had an agreement with coworker to overnight me anything if there was an issue  
o Agreed that in case of an IT issue that overnighting would not be able to resolve that I would fly back at my expense  
   
As you can see the process took some real time to put into place, as a bystander to the process it also seemed that having leverage on the company will give you a better negotiating position. In the case of Sam, he was willing to walk away from the job if they did not say yes to his proposal, another example of leverage would be a position with another company which does allow remote work.  
Another point that I wanted to stress, that it can be scary to quit but I do feel like it has been a positive decision.The last thing that I wanted to point out is that it is fairly cheap to live abroad, much cheaper than in the US. My typical expenses for a month including, lodging, flights, food, and other expenses are usually around $1,000. If you have a full-time job that pays $10/hr, your expenses would be covered, and if you are earning $15/hr you would even be able to save money. That is why it feels obtainable to me. A large part of me wanting to write this blog has been to document how this is type of life is far more obtainable than it seems."

I’ve been searching on Airbnb, but wanted to know if you guys had any tips to save money while traveling when working remotely? Was thinking Airbnb but it is pricy? Thoughts and anything helps :)"
lrdche,ajrw09za,Your favorite cheap European towns you've been to?,"Hello! American that's been waiting for the ""right time"" but you know it never will be. After reading that you can get apartments for $200/$300 a month in some places I'm realizing I can move out sooner than I thought. Looking for a nice place to hunker down while I remote work and do more extensive travel in the future.


What are some of your favorite European towns you've been to that are nice and the ""live around $500 a month"" type? I know lots more options open up at $1000 a month and I'd like to hear those suggestions too! I just want to try to shoestring it at this part of my life if I can.


I've been doing my own research on places like this (e.g. Bansko and I assume most of the cheap places will be east europe/balkan as well) and I'll keep doing research, but I just want to hear personal experiences from places that people have been!


I just want a town that's walkable/bikable, has nature (I like hills/mountains and don't like flat places but if you liked a flat place still tell me anyways!), cheap street food/farmers markets, livable while only knowing English (I don't need to socialize/""fit in"", just want to buy food and see the doctor easy with English), and it's silly but a place without ticks is a plus lol


Also would like it to be LGBT tolerant. I don't kiss or hold hands in public but I just don't want to get attacked if I'm clocked as gay, e.g. I don't want to go to Poland or Russia.


I keep imagining a beach town where I can get $2 food and bike to the beach from my apartment lol but I'll take any kind of nature. Canary Islands look nice but I don't know if 500 a month is doable there for this part of my life. Thank you for any suggestions!


Edit: I'm not wanting to travel month to month and live it up and jump to a random town on a whim just because it's the cheapest, It's a decision I will focus carefully on for a few years. I am dedicated to the ""rice and beans walk everywhere can't pay for entertainment"" shoestring budget, I just think it would be more enjoyable in a European town instead of in a run down trailer or out of a van. I understand the risks, I'm just getting to the point where I can't live in my house any more and I can't be told to ""just bear it"" because that's not an option. I would rather plan a decent place to live while I still have a house instead of having to wing out once I'm actually homeless."
lrfefe,ln27d,Kraków or Warsaw,For those that have been to both cities; which did you prefer and why? Looking to stay at one for 3-6 months (later in the year).
lrkx0s,1nag0ize,PSA: You will need more money than you think-stop thinking you can get by on a rock bottom budget,"I see a fair amount of posts from people (and also get some DMs) asking about budget, a lot of which are people thinking that they can become rich being a DN by living on an extremely frugal budget. Yes, you can go to a lower cost of living area and lower your expenses. But no, you cannot live on the budget of a 19 year old couch surfing and hostelling through Thailand and living on $8 a day while teaching English online a few days a week. Stop thinking you can do this.

1. You will need fast and reliable wifi no matter what your job is. Sometimes this is going to mean paying more to stay in a place with a connection or burning through data, having a hotspot, etc. You can't just stay wherever and hope for the best.
2. You need a private workspace or some kind of good co-working place. We've all seen a laptop photo of some dude on a beach or at a picnic table. Sounds nice for 30 minutes. Have you ever tried to do that for 8 hours a day for a few weeks? For most jobs you will need some privacy to make calls, teach classes, or just for peace of mind. This means paying enough to stay in a place with a good desk or table with privacy, likely with a decent office chair too. Otherwise maybe you're paying to access a co-working space or buying coffees at a decent cafe. You can work from anywhere for a couple of days but you cannot just do that for months on end. Your housing situation needs to account for this.
3. This is long-term. You have to budget for your health. If you're planning to be bouncing around the world for months or years then you need to account for all the health costs you are going to have. You need to budget in a balanced diet, not just whatever cheap street food is available. You will probably need health insurance unless your job gives it to you. Over the course of a few years you're going to have doctor and dentist appointments. You don't want to be living in a foreign country with a horrible toothache and unable to do anything about it. 
4. Shit can go really wrong. Think of all the people who got stuck places for months last year and suddenly had big expenses. You might get scammed or get robbed (hopefully not but it happens). You might book an airbnb only to discover it's disgusting or isn't safe and need to get somewhere else ASAP. All kind of stuff can happen and you have to have some savings to cover you. 

&#x200B;

Anyway I'm probably missing some things but the point is you have to think realistically. You're not just traveling to some place but you are going to live there and work."

lro2vj,90ujlnz9,Two bags for long term travel,"There's a lot of pressure in long-term travel communities to travel with just a carry-on bag.

So! I'm looking for stories from y'all about how you've survived--thrived, even!--with more than one suitcase for long term travel. What limitations do you feel it put on you? How did you cope with those? What did it allow you to bring that would have made travel uncomfortable without?

lrr8hh,pd6nea0,"CDMX, Oaxaca, Merida, Guadalajara or Playa Del Carmen for 30 y/o with 0 spanish?","Hi all, I've been googling all of the Mexico digital nomad threads I can find and am looking for advice on where I should go in April (I will be vaccinated by then, still wear masks, etc). 

I am a young single guy who will be pretty busy with work from 8-7pm M-Fri. The most important factor for me is that I'd like to meet up with people (other DNs, expats, or locals) at night to explore and go to places for dinner or drinks. I am leaning towards Mexico City since it is the largest and likely has the most happening. The complicating factor is that I don't speak any spanish (I have started learning but it will not be enough time to make a substantive difference) and also covid lockdowns. 

Decent internet (to support email, google voice and the occasional zoom call) is all I'll need for work. 

Can spend $500-1500 for accommodations (no shared apartments).

I've been to Mexico City a few times and to Oaxaca once (only for vacation), so the other places would be new.  I do like scenic and/or small walkable towns, but think it would be hard to balance with my language restraint and desire to meet people. 

Any suggestions or thoughts are welcome. Which would you do if you were in my position?"
lrvqwm,13fmt2,Which Country to start in Europe?,"Been planning my first digital nomad trip for a few months now and I think I have the basic structure of my plan. Wanted to get input from you guys especially if you have any experience staying in any of these places.

About me: 25 Male (American) fully remote job with 35k a year salary before bonus. Have full approval from the company and I don’t have to work set hours but I would like to stick somewhat close to company hours (8 Am pst to 4 pm Pst) just to keep myself accountable/meetings.

I’m aiming to have 5k saved before I leave in May but I’m not sure which country I want to start at but I narrowed it down to 2 options

**Option A**

Croatia ( 3 Months)

Turkey ( 1 - 2 Months)

Greece? (If EU Opens)

UK (1 Month)

EU Country (3 Months)

**Option B**

Georgia/Armenia ( 2- 3 Months)

Turkey ( 1- 2 Months)

Croatia (2 months)

EU Country (3 Months)

I would love to spend more time in the EU but obviously with the virus that might not even be a possibility this year. I don’t mind spending longer somewhere and slow traveling as I do want to focus on work first and foremost and I feel I'll mostly be exploring on weekends.

I think Option A would be really fun but it seems I’m going one way and then heading back as to where Option B I would kind of just follow a steady path. Also, I’m concerned about summer costs in Croatia as I know in Tbilisi I could save a good amount and I like the value of Airbnb. Hopefully, if the EU does open up this year I would like to be able to spend my holidays in more tourist cities like Rome, Paris, etc and obviously, the more money saved for that the better.

Side Note: I am Asian and I do have a sleeve and my hands are tatted but it’s pretty minimal, from my research I should be okay but is there any country that I should be concerned about with Racism/Tattoos?

Thanks in advance!"

lrz20p,5bnnni4o,Thoughts of DN lifestyle aboard sailboat?,"For the longest time, to live aboard a sailboat full time, sail the ocean, and travel new places became my biggest dream. There’s just nothing like deep blue waters. 

I’m still young and in college, building my savings for a down payment on a boat. And on a boat, in the middle of the atlantic - there’s no wifi. One of the biggest things to consider as a DN. IMO, I think Starlink could be the solution to this once they start making their services public. It handles about 150Mb/s, even on the waters. 

The career path I’m considering is Online Education. I don’t mean teaching english to Chinese students, but working as a marketing agent for one of these online institutions. 

I would love to get yalls takes on how to build a career in this segment (open to all ideas though), internet access, work/boat life balance, and sustainability of supporting this lifestyle. 

*Additional info*

- With a mortgage on a boat, my calculations for my ideal cruiser would be about $800-1500/month. Too bad it depreciates :/

- yearly living costs would round about be $23K, five or take some for locations, passengers, and repairs."
ls0oh8,6qd5hpl,Advice needed on becoming a Digital Nomad.,"Hello everyone I've been a long time lurker on this community. I've been fascinated with the digital nomad scene for a few years now and I've always wanted to travel around the world and work on projects I love and truly believe in. I'm currently a Software Engineer making good money ($200k\~ a year). Even though the money is good and the job is not stressful at all, I've always wanted to do my own thing and don't find myself being happy at work anymore.

I know the general advice is to do something on the side, once it kicks off then quit to do it full time. I've tried that for 2 years now and I've launched a few small projects, but it never got my anywhere. I feel like I don't have enough time out of my week to dedicate energy into turning my side project into full time job just because I code at work, then I code after work and on weekends and it's very easy to get burned out that way. I'm not saying that's the reason why those projects failed but I feel like they could've been a lot better if I can dedicate full time into it.

Should I quit and try this full time? I have savings and I was thinking of moving to somewhere relatively cheap (like Thailand) to keep costs relatively low. Then just work on a software project full time and hopefully monetize on it eventualy and do that for the rest of my life. Should I keep doing this part time thing and keep my great job? What should I do ?"
ls5b9a,30d5b0y2,"Working from Home is NOT ""The Dream""","COVID19 has exposed the working world to what it's really like working from home.  And despite the initial excitement of dropping the commute, avoiding annoying coworkers, and working in pajamas, most people are realizing that working from home ain't all it's cracked up to be.

Working from home gets old, quick.  We as digital nomads realized this long ago.  The dream is not working from home.  The dream is working on your own terms.  It's deciding you'll work at this coffee shop today, at that coworking space tomorrow.  It's deciding you'll work from your home office the day after.  Instead of working 9AM - 5PM, maybe you'll do 9AM - 11:30AM, then hop on again in the afternoon.

Working from home gets old, because a change of environment is healthy for the mind.  Working in the same place that you eat and sleep is generally depressing in my books.  It's nice to do occasionally, but when it becomes the routine, that's a problem.  There may be a coworker that bugs you, but there's also coworkers you like.  It's good to be around people.  Holing yourself up with no social interaction all day is not ""The Dream"".

I'm glad the general population is realizing this, because it seems they underestimated how difficult it can be to work without an office.  You have to put in effort to find the right balance, to remain social, to rotate through different environments.  If you don't make that effort, then it's very easy to separate yourself from the world and get into a rut.  Being a digital nomad is not easy.  Working from home is not easy.  

We are blessed to have the opportunity to choose our environment.  Make no mistake of that.  But it's our responsibility to build out a balanced and healthy lifestyle.  Some people just can't handle that.  Some people like structure and being told where and when to work.  This lifestyle is not for everyone.  There's nothing wrong with you if it doesn't fit."

lxttxj,3eu0an0h,Please seek QUALIFIED tax advice,"I am a CPA with specialized knowledge /20+ years of experience in “Global Mobility Services” area, providing services to fortune 100 companies. 

I am so sick of reading the comments/“expert advice” given on this forum from people who have no qualification in this area. 

1. If you want to do things RIGHT, please seek QUALIFIED professional advice. Google and internet is not “qualified advice”, otherwise, I would not have a high-paying job. (Obviously, if you don’t care about laws/rules, you do you.) 

2. If you work for an employer, especially a large company, your extended stay overseas might create “exposure” for the company (immigration/labor law/corporate tax/transfer pricing/payroll withholding obligations, etc.etc.), even if you are OK with taking risk on the individual tax return/reporting side. For a lot of (large) companies, these are much bigger concerns than your individual US and foreign countries’ tax returns/compliance requirements. 

3. Let’s say you don’t give a damn about #1 and #2, please at a minimum, do not buy into the “popular” statement on this forum (“if you make less than 107K, you don’t need to pay any US taxes”), referring to “foreign earned income exclusion (FEIE)”. 

That’s NOT accurate or at least, there are a lot of other things to consider! (The list below is not intended to be exhaustive!) 

(A). FEIE is federal rule; some states do not follow federal rules. Especially if you are temporary living overseas and the state has “domicile” rules with regards to tax residency. 

(B). If you are working and living in a “high tax jurisdictions” and paying taxes there, taking FEIE is a bad idea. You should probably go “Foreign Tax Credit” (FTC) route. 

(C). FEIE is an IRREVOCABLE election. Once you claim it on any US tax return, you are stuck with it for life (unless you get specific written consent to revoke it from the IRS). Please do NOT take this election lightly! I have seen many people (especially high income earners) having absolutely detrimental tax results in later part of their life because they did not know this and made FEIE election without knowing it.

(D). be aware of “stacking rules” (if you make 200k, and was able to exclude 100K, assuming you meet all conditions), the left over 100K will be taxed from the tax rates of 100K-200K, not from 0-100K.

(E). (this is the point I always laugh at when I read people comment on here, as if they are tax expert when their entire knowledge and source is google) the whole 330 days out 365 days in foreign country to qualify for FEIE, that’s only ONE method if you REALLY want to go the FEIE route (see point (C) above). There is the “bona fide residency” test instead of physical presence test that you can explore. 

NONE of my comments above or below should be taken as advice; because they are not. Accurate advice always require a complete analysis of your specific facts and circumstances. 

PLEASE seek professional (and qualified) tax guidance, rather listening to or rely on random internet search/comment. This is a specialized area of tax law (and changes often), a lot of CPAs in the US are not qualified, let alone random people on the internet.

Edit: fixed a few typo.

Edit#2: OK, the post blowed up a bit more than I expected. Therefore want to emphasize/clarify a few points:

(1). I am NOT here to debate tax laws or offer tax advice to anyone, even though I am confident that I am more qualified than most of the folks on here who made comments to “disqualify or debate” with what I stated. 

(2). I am NOT an accountant, even though I am a fully licensed CPA. As I said, my clients are Fortune 100 companies. I am strictly prohibited from soliciting any businesses. If you personally had bad experience dealing with certain professionals in the past, sorry to hear that; but that’s not a valid basis to encourage others to blindly follow “Google/Reddit” comments. 

(3). At the end of the day, it is your life and it is your choices. I fully respect that. 
However, in my opinion, there is a big difference between someone choosing to take certain risks for themselves (often unknowingly) vs. someone choosing to convince others to take certain risks (knowingly) because they THINK they are the experts."
lxupqr,4ixmdbrs,12days to 1 month locations in US,"Hey All,

Random question. I am looking for a place to stay for atleast 12 days but going up to a month. Originally was looking at southern California but the prices on airbnb are extremely expensive. The goal is to be close to a beach and hiking trails but with good food options. Has anyone else giving this a try on the sub before? I am trying to use the last few months of remote work to my advantage before everyone is vaccinated.

Mr. W"
ly2qgo,2gyrhki6,Been working from a different state in the US without telling my employer- will HR notice if I use their health insurance from a different state?,"I've been working remotely since COVID started, and have been staying in a different state for a few months without telling my company. They're fairly strict about what states we can live in for tax reasons, and I'm not sure whether the state I'm in is one that they'd be ok with- either way, they expect all of us to come back to the office once COVID is under control.

For a variety of reasons that would take too long to explain, I strongly desire not to move back to my old home state, and will have to find another job if keeping the job means that I have to go back there and to the office. For one, I have severe social anxiety, and hated every moment of being in the office. I'm wondering if I can have this diagnosed by a professional and ask to keep working remote as a reasonable accommodation, and whether using the health insurance I get through my employer to see a professional while living in a different state is likely to cause any problems for me or for the company. I may consider just travelling back to my old state for this purpose, but would prefer not to if I don't have to. 

I have already bnegged all the way up to the CEO to stay remote after COVID, and have been repeatedly blown off, and the CEO has repeatedly stated that the company will never go fully remote, even though we have dozens of employees all over the US and the rest of world who have been fully remote for years. I want to go full nomad soon, but am willing to relocate to any state that will not cause tax problems for the company if my current one does, as I'm happy to live anywhere other than the state I moved from. 

I would greatly appreciate any insight or advice anyone can give here, because trying to figure out my future right now is causing me a lot of stress. I don't consider myself to have a lot of highly desirable skills, so finding another decent job that is remote probably won't be easy."
lzsodu,8nant,"I surveyed the top 300 posts in /r/DigitalNomad, this is what I found","I hope someone sees this because it took forever lol.

I previously did a post of the top 100 posts of /r/digitalnomad. I wanted to do the top 500 but you can only look at so many laptops, so I got through the top 300. I also wanted to survey more information this time around. My primary interest is in DN jobs, but I also included things like types of posts, locations, genders, boat/van content, beverages, etc. It took way longer than it should have since reddit servers were being buggy and I kept losing my place and having to scroll all the way back down lol.

I'm weirdly obsessed with this sub, both with the content but also the varied approach to digital nomadism. I start my own digital nomad journey in a few weeks, so I guess I'm a little antsy to get going which inspired this. Hope someone finds this stuff as interesting as I did.

**Types of Posts**

I tried to get a general sense of what kinds of posts are popular in /r/DigitalNomad. I differentiated the humor posts because they were more satire/tongue-in-cheek and not standard posts. 48% of posts were just pictures of laptops in exotic places, with another 18% of posts being pictures of scenic locations (often with the assumed laptop out-of-frame).

**Jobs**

Of the 300 posts, 115 posters indicated jobs worked either in the title or (more often) in the comments. This does not account for reposters. For example, /u/Joshuarhys91 accounts for eleven ""Photographer"" jobs because he posts frequently and his posts typically get upvoted to the heavens, but I did not want to go through and check 300 posts for frequent/multiple contributors. So for that reason, this is likely skewed a bit (especially for Photographers). Some of these job titles could also probably be combined.

Fun fact: of the DN posts in Mexico, 7 of them were in Tulum specifically (so 33% of Mexico DNs are in Tulum).

**Other Miscellaneous Tidbits**

*Genders*

There were 24 posts where OP was visible in the actual photo video, and of those 24, 92% of them were male (22 males, 2 females). There were many more posts that directly or indirectly indicated gender throughout the comments but I only included visible OPs.

*Vans & Boats*

31 of the 300 posts were about nomads in vans (again, /u/Joshuarhys91 skews this as he accounts for 11 of the top 300 posts and all of his are van-related).

Two people were on boats.

*Food & Drink*

In the posts with visible food/drinks: 7 contained alcohol, 12 had coffee, 1 had an energy drink, 2 had soda, 1 had tea, 7 had water, 1 had hot chocolate, 12 had unspecified beverages, 11 had various combinations of drinks and foods, and 1 guy had weed.

m0n7q0,4u3ot,My 1.5 years as a digital nomad.,"This story involves two people, my partner and I, who embarked on our nomadic journey, which started in Medellin, Colombia, in June ~~2018~~ 2019. 
Our travel style is slower, aiming to stay at each country for at least three months. We only leave a country or a place early if one of us doesn’t like it or it doesn’t meet our basic standards: clean air, access to clean water, and a safe place. The only cities we have left because these criteria were not met were Da Nang, Vietnam and Bangkok, Thailand. The pollution was too much for me, and I found it depressing to have to walk around with a N95 mask just to breathe well. Oh, how naïve we were before the pandemic.

We started with two suitcases and two backpacks, and we’ve been able to pare down to one suitcase and two backpacks, and it’s been one of the best decisions we’ve made. 

We are both professionals, she’s a medical biller and I’m a translator. Our incomes are above the *begpacker* tourist, but way below the IT Digital Nomad, and actually match the amount from [this response](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/lrkx0s/psa_you_will_need_more_money_than_you_thinkstop/gomqnyf/) in a [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/lrkx0s/psa_you_will_need_more_money_than_you_thinkstop/).


Our total monthly budget is 2,000 USD, this means we both have to make $1,000 per month to stay afloat. Of course, we have a nice savings account for emergencies.

**Our budget is something like this:**

* Rent: $800
* Groceries: $400
* Phone/Data: $40
* Personal care: $50
* Transportation: 50
* Total: 1,340
* Play money and savings: 660

We don’t pay for health insurance. We’ve had to go to the doctor a few times, but we have been able to pay small amounts that didn’t break our bank. 

We approach our lodging in a two-part system. First, we book an Airbnb for about a week, preferably on a weekend, so that we can immediately start looking at properties advertised on Facebook Marketplace or Facebook local communities. I make sure to join those weeks in advance to look at possible rentals and also post my own ad to gather some prospects, which we’ll go visit once we’re there. 
If there’s nothing good on those groups, I go to Airbnb where I contact the hosts and tell them I’d like to see the place in person. If I meet up with them, and I agree on the place I book under the table. So far, I’ve only had one host in Mérida, México turn this offer down.

**My requirements for housing are:** 


Mandatory:
 
* Fast and reliable internet over 20 Mbps 
* Comfortable working spaces for both of us. This means no hammocks or recliner chairs; I need a real table with chairs.
* A safe neighborhood. I’ll often ask the host for address or the cross streets to check street view on Google.
* The place should not exceed $35 per night 
* It should have a Kitchen, not a kitchenette.
* Washer, if not available check on laundry services provided by host or nearby.
* Make sure it’s a non-smoking unit.
 
**Preferred:**
 
* Proximity to supermarkets and dining places
* A walkable area. Good walking score. 
* Close to green or recreational spaces, such as parks or plazas. 
 
**This is my personal warning regarding this list.**
Do not book unless these items have been vetted or we will regret it. Remember Prague and Merida, two trap houses that could have been avoided.

Since we don’t often eat outside, and we’re picky about our food, we prefer having a real kitchen where we can cook what we want without having to go out and scavenge for food.  
On that note, the blog-peddled idea of $1 dollar meals is hard to come by. We’ve had our share or inexpensive meals, but they have not been that great. There have been notable exceptions in Bangkok (possibly the world’s best street food), Medellín, and Da Nang.


**Some tips for aspiring nomads:**

* Get a good credit card, you will need it. I buy everything on my credit card and pay it at the end of the month.
* Open a Schwab account, they refund all your ATM fees at the end of the month. I’ve seen refunds as big as $20 for me, so I’m definitely glad to have one.


**Biggest ~~mistakes~~ lessons:**

* If you are ever setting foot in Vietnam or passing by, double and triple check that you don’t need a Vietnamese Visa. I ended up having to get a “rush” visa to enter Vietnam, even though my final destination was Bali, and I had to pay $500 for their scam, printed on a dot-matrix printer, otherwise the Chinese authorities wouldn’t let me through.
* We used Trusted Housesitters for a visit to New Zealand and didn’t have a good experience with the hosts who expected more things from us than what they had initially disclosed in their post, by then we were in an island near the bottom of the planet. We won’t use them again.
* I made an inventory spreadsheet of everything we own, and it’s been a time saver during packing, as well as ensuring that I stop leaving random things behind.

**My gear:**

* Macbook air with an iPad Pro as a second monitor using Sidecar
* Roost laptop stand: an incredible stand and with a great warranty, which I used once, and they replaced my stand without any hassle.
* iKlip Multimedia stand: possibly the best stand there is, but also a bit heavier.
* Mac Spanish keyboard
* “Maxell” Bluetooth mouse. I’m old enough to remember this company made cassette tapes."

m1a5e2,tyko3,Changing your entire career (to another field). Any experience?,"Any DN here who used to work in one field and now works in a different one? Can you share your experiences?

The thing is, I'm in a quarter-life crisis (or almost mid-life, I'm 32 haha). I've been working in online marketing my entire career, which is about eight years. I'm sick of it. I initially chose a marketing major during my business degree because I was young and dumb and thought marketing will allow me to work in a super creative field. I got hired by some interesting companies and ended up doing online marketing, mostly affiliate and PPC.

I haven't been happy in a long time. I don't absolutely hate what I do, but it bores me so much that I often don't even find the motivation to do anything, and I'm sick that a huge part of my job is just constantly analyzing and interpreting data. 

I know, I should be grateful I'm even able to work during Covid times. But I know I need a change. I don't even think I wanna stay in the marketing field at all. I'd be willing to do online courses, bootcamps or even a whole new degree. I'm not really interested in coding unfortunately, but I'm interested in designing and video editing for example.

I'm not sure though if I should really change my entire career. There will be kids younger than me with more experience, and I'm worried I'll never find a job or freelance gigs. Any advice? And I'd love to hear your experience if you're one of those who changed career after years i the same field.

m1gz6m,e3uso,Safety Wing Insurance review,"TL;DR don't use safetywing


I was hiking in the mountains of Nepal March of 2020 when Safetywing sent out emails stating that you needed to contact them within ten days to receive coverage for political evacuations, as you might imagine there isn't much internet connection at high altitude. Not only is it shady to make me request something that I should already be covered from under my policy, but doing it before there is any announcements of political evacuations where I would know I need the coverage is absurd. 

Once I had taken the US embassy chartered flight back to the US in early April, I began to file my claim with Safetywing, I was unable to submit the final cost however until the US state department notified me of the total cost in October, we weren't informed before then of the total cost only given an estimate.

After calling into TokioMarine, Safetywing's underwriter, for several months requesting escalation after escalation, I was finally denied on the grounds of ""not covered by policy"".

There are plenty of posts on this forum that indicate that simple isn't the case, they only want to dissuade policy holders from demanding their pay out. 

I wouldn't advise anyone to pick up a Safetywing policy unless you enjoy endless phone tag and run arounds trying to have them make good on your claims."

m1nwof,9lp2,Best VOIP provider with SMS support to port a US number to?,"Hi all,

I used to be on T-Mobile when I lived in the US and loved the service. I ported the number to Line2 which was a [terrible mistake](https://www.reddit.com/r/line2/comments/fdmg92/line2_review_regular_outages_seemingly_no_spam/). The only thing going for them is a desktop client (that crashes and doesn't usually work, but it *sometimes works*) and SMS with push notifications, MMS, and group SMS support.

What providers are folks using to keep their numbers? Important features for me are:

* <$10 month
* Some sort of spam call filtering, either automated like T-Mobile used to do or even a simple auto attendant ""Press 1 to reach u/chrisgagne""
* Meaningful SMS support (push notifications, can reply in app)

What are y'all using? :) NumberBarn and MagicJack both seem like contenders, though NumberBarn doesn't do SMS push notifications nor has an app. MagicJack is more expensive. Neither has group SMS support.

Google Voice isn't currently a great option for me as a) last time I used them they filter out DTMF tones on incoming calls, b) they don't officially support people outside of the US, and c) I'd need to port my number to a wireless carrier first and that's a hassle from overseas."

m2b7sp,58t6sb3a,Finally decided we are making the leap!! Thoughts on our plan?,"Hey everyone,

Overwhelmingly excited to say my SO and I (both graduating University with an M.A. and B.S respectively this may), have officially decided to adopt this lifestyle upon graduation. For some extremely brief background, we both have always wanted to travel, however prior to the last 6 months, we always thought it would happen later in life (30s). We had intentions of moving to Indianapolis after graduation, and building up a real estate portfolio there throughout our 20s, and travel once we had comfortable income from investments. 

The plans have changed very quickly, because our priorities have shifted away from maximizing wealth building as fast as possible, to building wealth at a different pace while exploring the world while we are still young. We don't want to wait...The plan is to stay in Indy for 3 months, and then bounce to various U.S. cities  that we've always wanted to see in order to take advantage of working remotely for a U.S based company. This way, we can save money and have some time to figure out how we will produce income once leaving the country (I'm guessing my company wouldn't let me continue with them if I moved internationally). Any thoughts on this mindset? Do you think it is smart to begin nomadic travels in our home country in order to continue working with a stable income, while figuring out what we are going to do once abroad?

We have thought about house-hacking, (purchasing 1 home in Indy and living there for one year while renting it out, and then having a Managment company take over while we are abroad), however the risks of major issues, bad tenants, and repairs scare us much more since our priorities have shifted towards living this nomadic lifestyle. Do you think we are making the right move by pushing our real estate investments to later in life, and starting our nomadic journey here instead?

**SUMMARY**: Original plan was to house-hack for 1 year in Indianapolis, then move abroad. New plan is to nomadically live in the United states while saving money from my U.S. based remote work, and leave the U.S. as soon as we figure out viable plans for income. While I am obsessed with the idea of beginning our nomadic journey here in the US the moment we graduate,  **Pushing off real estate investments is a major decision for me, and a difficult one to make. However, we feel nomad living has become so much of a priority to us, that we simply don't want to risk a major 10k repair or a horrible tenant severely setting back our travel plans.**"

I’ve been traveling for quite a bit and every time I move to a new country, I change my phone number. The issue is when I use my credit card, my bank is sending me a confirmation code to my phone. Is there any way I could forward those automatic codes to an app/email or sth? So I could stop changing phone number and receive those code even using wifi.

I am about to graduate college, and am expecting a remote job offer from my current employer (company based out of NY State). I know nothing here will constitute actual legal advice, but am looking to be pointed in the right direction.

I plan on traveling the U.S. for some time, staying in different cities for 1 - 3 months at a time upon graduation. How does this work tax wise? Where do I get my next drivers license? Where am I a resident of? Do I need to pay taxes in each state I stay in for only 3 months or less, or would it not count because that probably won't meet any type of domicile / residency requirements? Do I only pay NY income taxes even though I won't be in NY at all? This is all very confusing, and I certainly don't want this lifestyle to jeopardize my employer wanting to deal with the complications (however I would never give up our choice to travel of course). 

I am a current resident of CT, attending school in NY and working for a NY company. Considering I won't actually be ""living"" long-term in any one state, what do I tell my employer, and how do I handle all of the tax implications.

I plan on speaking to a CPA that specializes in nomadic living soon enough, but am concerned about everything! Help is much appreciated :)"

m41uw6,74ehjrgn,Looking for career advice to eventually start DN lifestyle,"**Tl;DR** \- Currently working as QA tester with an option to transition into QA automation within my company. Not sure if I should continue with the path of QA automation and eventually try to find a remote job and travel OR study software development and after getting some experience - try to find some gigs that require 0 experience OR while having no experience with it - find a way to work within the self development field (or any other field as long as I enjoy the process)

Hello,

I'm 26 years old with almost four years of experience as a QA tester, (currently working as QA tech lead for a start-up). I like my job but I want to explore other options and eventually live my dream as a DN.

I feel lost and not sure what would be the best thing to do to eventually afford this lifestyle (would prefer to earn less as long as it gives me the freedom of time and travel). I have the opportunity to transition to QA automation and I have started learning selenium with python. 

My real problem is that I don't know if it's the best path to try and find work as remote QA automation (and if it's even possible) after I get some experience within my company. Or to study software development (which currently won't be possible to get experience within my current working place). 

I also really like teaching and self-development and naturally found myself always ranting and trying to help people with their life problems, but have zero experience in that sphere and no idea how or where to start. I feel drawn to it but thought that it might be better to progress in something that already provides for me.

Honestly if I can have the freedom of travel and have time for it, (right now I'm working 45 hours a week...kinda hard traveling and experiencing the world like this) I wouldn't mind switching to any other sphere as long as I enjoy the process (thought about affiliate marketing or trading stocks/crypto currencies) . I have an eye for details, I'm creative and willing to put the work to achieve my goals.

Would really appreciate any guidance/tips/insights, thank you :)"

m4b6vo,avz9ii38,Best Phillipines Visa?,"Hi All,

I'm a grad student at Georgia Tech and I would like to live in the Philippines as soon as a I graduate (which is in a year). I have been reading many articles about PH as well as scavenging as much information as I can about the different kinds of visas and even how to apply for citizenship. I work in software (AI/ML track) so job-wise it will very likely be some sort of Remote NLP/CV Python Developer role. I would like to become a permanent resident, and find the process from what I've read a bit convoluted. Maybe you guys could help me pick the best kind of visa :). As far as I understand it, most DMs living there for temporary accomodation just get a three-year stay non-immigrant visa (for $450) or just keep extending their 30 day non-visa stay for upto 36 months. I also read on the Phillipine Bureau of Immigration website that I can apply for a Section 13 permanent resident visa if I meet the following criteria:  

* **13 Quota immigrants**, of which no more than fifty of any one nationality may be admitted within one calendar year
* **13 (A)** The spouse or unmarried child (below 21) of a Filipino citizen
* **13 (B)** Children born during a temporary visit abroad to mothers granted permanent residence in the Philippines
* **13 (C)** Children born after the issuance of the visa of the accompanying parents
* **13 (D)** Women who lost Filipino citizenship by virtue of marriage to a foreign spokes, and her unmarried children
* **13 (E)** Permanent residents returning to the Philippines from a temporary visit abroad to resume permanent residence
* **13 (F)** The spouse and or unmarried children of a foreigner admitted to the country for permanent residence prior to the approval of the Philippine Immigration Act
* **13 (G)** Natural-born Filipinos and their dependents who have been naturalized in a foreign country and wish to permanently reside in the Philippines

So either I get married to a local or I luck out on the quota. 

There is another option I was reading about that is possible for someone truly very determined to live there for good: 

 

* **SNIV** Special Non-Immigrant Visa. Non-immigrant visa granted to foreign nationals and their dependents who are employed by the regional, area and/or regional operating headquarters of multinational corporation

The other ""Special Visa"" types don't really seem to apply to me (they're all described here): 

[https://www.philippinesvisa.com/visa-policy/](https://www.philippinesvisa.com/visa-policy/) 

I don't qualify for the Special Retiree Visa b/c I am not 35 yet (alas).

The other option is to get a citizenship; since I'm not of Filipino birth or heritage I will have to renounce the US citizenship and have a petition to the Office of the Solicitor General approved for a local passport.

This is my current understanding of the permanent residency process. My question is this: Is there any way to maintain an American job ( say, for a firm based in Boston ) and live in the PH for > 3 years? If not, what kind of ""regional, area and/or regional operating headquarters of multinational corporation"" roles would I qualify for? For example, would I have to take a job for a firm based in Tokyo and argue that it is ""regional""?

I apologize if I seem kind of all over the place; couldn't really condensce it, alas."

I just started investing in a TFSA while abroad but realized it is for Canadian residents only (not citizens) and non-residents get slammed with fines for doing so (1% per month). To all the Canadian DNs out there who spend more than 6 months per year out and about, are you using TFSAs and/or RRSPs while not technically being resident in Canada?     
    
Also curious if you tell the CRA that you are gone, because then contribution room wouldn't be added too if you're a non resident, which could lead to problems in the future if you max out at number higher than you should. But the limit is set by the CRA, based on info that you may or may not tell them...     
    
I just never mentioned to the CRA that I left, and just pay full tax to CRA on my online earnings, but am concerned that this TFSA will mess things up."

m4tdoy,82vtbdp9,How to negotiate becoming nomadic in my current software developer office job?,"Hey everyone,

Aspiring nomad here.
Current situation for me:

* I’ve been working as a fullstack software dev for 1,5 years for the same company, in Denmark
* My goal is to transition into becoming a DN and working 100% remotely
* I have a MSc in Computer Science, graduated in 2019

I figured that I’ve been in the same company for a while now, so it’s time to make something happen.

For the past year, we’ve been working remotely a lot of the time in this company. Lately only going into the office once per week. So I think this adds leverage - I’ve demonstrated I can produce results while working from home. Also, this company hires a lot of new people because they're expanding, so they need experienced people like me that knows the ins and outs of the system


Next week, we have 1-on-1 “interviews” with a software guy from management, to talk about how’s it going etc.
I’m on good terms with this guy. My plan is to ask this guy if it would be okay if I went fully remote for a full month, just as a test. Because I feel I’ve been more productive working from home.

Once I get permission for that, and having worked from home for a full month while producing excellent work, I’d try to extend that indefinitely and also ask for permission to travel at the same time.

The question is. Should I bring up that I will start traveling as well at some point? I feel it’s necessary at some point. Because if they see me suddenly logging in from a different country, they might notice and ask questions. How would you do this? I also suspect there may be HR/Legal issues with me going nomadic. I would have to continue having a home address in my current country, etc.

If this plan fails, I will start applying for fully remote positions.
But it would be amazing if I could stay at my current company. An alternative plan is to ask for a 6month leave, go travel (because I have the savings), try to find a remote job in the meanwhile, and if all else fails, I will just return home after 6 months and start working again.


**Have any of you managed to accomplish this - transition from a software developer job and becoming fully remote (and being allowed to travel), while working for the same company? How did you do it?**

What would you do if you were in my situation? Thanks a lot for reading :)"
m4vclx,9tziaa96,How safe are you feeling lately living in digital nomad countries?,"Hey guys, 

I'm living in Oaxaca, Mexico for around a year now. I've done all the digital nomad cities before (Chiang Mai, Medellin, Ubud, etc.). But recently I started wondering - the countries that nomads love are usually 3rd world countries, where the wealth gap is huge. That's why we're able to afford many things, while locals are usually not that fortunate.   


Anyhow, I've recently started seeing a trend here in Oaxaca, that there are far more robberies, assaults, etc. than there used to be before. Since most of the $ comes from tourism here and it was shut off for at least 6-8 months, now these people are struggling big time.   


So my question to you - how does the place where you're staying feels like right now? Have noticed any difference?"

I've been living in Mexico for 6 months now, been to 4 cities (Playa del Carmen, Mexico City, San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato).

I really liked Mexico City, but Guanajuato is no less cool. It is rather small but still doesn't lack infrastructure since it is the capital city of Guanajuato state.

Very vibrant city with lots of colorful houses in Mexican style and classic architecture in the center with a European vibe. Uber is extremely cheap, the internet in my house is above 80 Mbit/s most of the time.

Vivo cafe is the only coffee shop I found in the center of the city which serves specialty coffee. Decent internet there also and almost no people, so I don't feel ashamed for occupying a table there for 3 hours with my laptop. There is also El Gregario Coffee House which should be promising but it's kinda far from the center and only opens at 2:00 pm, so I haven't had a chance to visit it yet.

Also, my Airbnb is wonderful. It is a colonial-style house for 4 or 5 families, which is currently empty for reasons everyone knows about. So we managed to negotiate a nice price of $700 for 4 weeks including all the fees and taxes for an apartment with 2 bedrooms, fireplace, a very spacious living area, a giant table for 6 persons. It also has 2 big terrases, a cute garden and two dogs which sometimes bark in the middle of the night for half an hour.

It also has an international airport nearby with lots of flights to the US. I'm leaving in a week as my visa is coming to an end. Hope Guatemala will not disappoint me :)"

melmjk,1h03716d,Freelance vs. Full-time Remote,"I work as a graphic designer/illustrator. I’ve been full-time freelance for 1.5 years and it’s gone exceedingly well, so while I’m hesitant to change anything, I know there are some clear benefits to going FT. I’ve recently been offered a full-time remote position (w/ full benefits) by one of my clients, and am considering it. This client is already the bulk of my income, making up 70% of my freelance salary as is. 

The salary is slightly less but on par with what I make freelancing, and I would still plan to freelance 10-20 hours a week where I can. The team seems pretty relaxed (from what I can tell). This role would be as a graphic designer, but the plan is to train me as a UX designer as well.

I anticipate my day-to-day life will look pretty similar (being that I'll be remote & they’re already my main client), but I fear losing my sense of freedom when it comes to my schedule and being my own boss. I also dread the potential social obligations like virtual happy hours, christmas parties, etc. As well as keeping up appearances when it comes to feeding into office politics, even if it’s remote. I love that with freelancing, I never know what project I’ll take on next. And if a project/client sucks, I can always leave. With full-time, I generally have an idea of what my life looks like for the next few years. Whether that sounds secure or boring, I’m not sure.

meu817,gjgrf,Thailand STV/General Access,"First time going to Thailand itself (Done many of the surrounding countries pre-covid) and just wanting to make sure I'm doing homework correctly and not missing anything.

There's a decent list of requirements to get into Thailand, including medical insurance coverage for the duration.  I found [this site](https://www.thaiembassy.com/thailand-visa/special-tourist-visa-thailand) that seems to be pretty cohesive coverage over the requirements specifically for STV, but according to [https://thaiembdc.org/visa_tourist_coe/](https://thaiembdc.org/visa_tourist_coe/) the requirements aren't that much different than just the non-visa 45 day entry.  I figured I'd ask around here before poking the consulate in case there's another way to get something longer than 45 days.  Things might change a lot more by the time August rolls around, but I prefer trying to start ironing this stuff out earlier rather than later.

* Is there alternative or more useful information on what counts as a “Health Certificate” according to the requirements?
* The STV is limited only to low risk countries where you are a citizen of, not where you are originating from, correct?
* If the above is true, as my citizenship is a high risk country, despite not having been there for months, are there other visa options for stays longer than 45 days that would be worth considering? Or should I look elsewhere in SEA (that is still somewhat restricted) for a destination by August?
* Is there better information than what is presented in the above site that I need to prepare (or services) in order to meet the requirements for entry? Even just tips on quarantine hotel (I'll most likely be arriving in BKK, but not familiar enough with the country to feel locked in there yet, visa first!)"
mf2ba6,11rv5k,Banking for non-us/non-eu nomads,"So I’m 3 months into a full time remote job that I hadn’t expected to occur.  I’ve been living in China for years and I don’t really have much contacts at home (Belize). I literally have spent most of my adult life abroad so I don’t have an address, bank account or phone number there.  

I’ve been trying to find a way to setup location agnostic banking to receive salary. 

My biggest issue is that every nomad friendly service assumes 1 of 2 things:
1) US or EU citizen 
2) have non-China address 

My current company wanted to me setup transferwise but I can’t actually get the money into China even if I use a Chinese address (can’t send to local accounts if verified from China). 

So my question is what are the banking options are there for someone going nomad whose current base is China and has no addresses elsewhere?

Edit:
- I’ve looked into a wise card but it’s only for EU citizens. 
- HSBC Hong Kong doesn’t treat my passport with respect

Edit edit: so far I’m leaning towards a dukascopy account. Seems to be the most viable option."
mf2gbw,5tgkqru9,Where to spend 1 month in Balkans in May?,"So, my gf and I received some free tickets from Istanbul to Tiran and from Pristine to İstanbul(we live in İstanbul). We can use these tickets for any flights before mid-June. Currently, both of us work from home and our firms are okay with working from abroad. I have always wanted to experience nomadic life style and now we have a real chance to do it. However, we really have little to no idea about where to go. Our criteria:
1) The country should be visa free to Turks which drops our options to Albania, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosova, Macedonia, Bosnia
2) The country should be safe regarding COVID-19 (we are very careful about it and didn't experience any problems but we are also not vaccineted)
3) The city/town should be near to sea and have a warm climate
4) Overall stay should be cheap. We have a total budget of 800€ for everything (Thanks to low TRY value)
5) Since we will be spend most of our time in one city, it would be perfect if it is lively 
6) An international community would be a super bonus

We are currently thinking about Montenegro and Albania. We really appreciate any ideas.

Stay safe"

I'm looking into putting together my setup for remote working/ traveling, etc. I'm planning to be in on the road for a long period of time, primarily car camping in and around rural areas in Canada. This means posting up in a café, library or coworking space will often not be an option. To me, the logical solution is to grab an unlimited data plan (such as [Bell's Unlimited 50 plan](https://www.bell.ca/Mobility/Cell_phone_plans/Unlimited-plans) ) for my phone and use a hotspot for myself, or to use a product/ service such as [Skyroam](https://www.skyroam.com/) . The problem is that all of these types of services seem to meter the speed after anywhere from 20-50GB, and I'll need far more than that. Is anyone aware of a plan or service that will provide *truly* unlimited data? The only decent alternative I've seemed to find is Starlink, which isn't available just yet in Canada and looks to be quite pricey (factoring in the hardware and setup costs). 

I'm also interested in hearing about what others are doing when travelling internationally, as I plan to do something similar outside of Canada once covid gets better.

I'm planning on doing the digital nomad thing for the first time for 1-2 months whenever I can travel again (hopefully later this year, I'm thinking around October).

I am looking for some ideas for places in the southwest of the US to stay while working. The reason I picked southwestern US is because I want to go somewhere where the weather is nice in October/November, and where people speak English. Ideally I would like some suggestions of places that will be sunny and warm most of the time (the place I live in Europe it rains most days), where I would have outdoorsy things to do nearby (hikes, things like that), and where there are lots of people my age (mid twenties). 

My plan at the moment is to stay in Santa Barbara for 1 month, and then travel around a bit for another month, but I am looking for suggestions/alternatives too. The reason I picked Santa Barbara is because I spent about a week there before while on a road trip on the west coast of the US, and really loved it. I think it is the closest thing to paradise I have ever experienced. But it is very expensive, and I'm sure there are a lot of similar places that I don't know exist, so I'd love to hear suggestions!

Here's a link to the Henley Passport Index which ranks passports based on how many visa free access each gets. Japan is at number 1 while countries like Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan are at the bottom.

We have 3 requirements:

\- not crowded (our kids won't be vaccinated by the summer so we want to avoid touristy places)

\- near beach

\- not too hot weather (we love hiking and cycling which is impossible in 30+ degrees)

So far I've found Ericeira in Portugal (but I think there will be too hot weather in summer) and something more up north in the Netherlands.

I've settled in on the Tortuga Setout 35L (thanks to r/digitalnomad!) but now trying to get a good laptop bag. I carry two laptops, a 16 mac for the biz and a 15"" Dell for the day job, as well as an iPad. I like the idea of having a separate personal/laptop bag, just in case I'll have to check in the 35L for some reason. I can't risk losing my source of income.  


Any recommendations for a bag that meets the following?  
\- can carry 2x \~16"" laptops and an ipad  
\- backpack straps for the long walk through airports \~18 lbs of gear, but ideally also a messenger bag sized strap just lugging around day to day.

So far I've been looking at Tumi, Dell Pro Hybrid and The Solo Hybrid Briefcase. Not as worried about price (within reason) but more about something that will be easy to live with and carry for a few years.  
Do you like carrying a smaller laptop bag along with your main bag, especially those of you that rock multiple laptops? Do you carry messenger-style  bags or backpack style and just wear it on the front?

mlqzdf,4x14j7n9,Long-Term Storage Options For Digital Nomads,"Hi, I'm Jack from Nomad Tactics,

I'm starting this post off by saying that I think although most of the digital nomads practice minimalistic lifestyle, I think some of us still face the problem of how to store the belongings long-term.

And I think when Covid is coming to an end, more and more people is going to be coming back to this digital nomad life and I'm sure many of them will face this problem before they start their traveling.

Here again I try to list out all the option. I personally only used storing in my family's place and self storage option.

### General considerations about storing your belongings

* We assume you don't own a place, obviously. Because if you were to be the owner of a property the most obvious solution to this topic would be for you to leave the things at your place and go live your digital nomad life.
   * Even if you intend to rent out the flat or list it on Airbnb this should not be a big worry, since you could rent it “furnished” with your things.
* Things to consider before storing your things
   * Is it worth storing in the first place?
      * Before you consider where to store your things, consider the value of your items as well as their utility. Are you paying more for a long-term storage unit than your things are worth? If it’s cheaper to sell your old items and buy new ones to replace them, then you don’t need to worry about storing things.
      * Get rid of your things might be a good option
   * For how long you intend to store your things?
      * Potentially if you want to be a digital nomad you are thinking to do this for the long-haul.
      * Therefore, it is important to keep in mind that, some of the storing options that we are about to explore (e.g. storing with family and friends) are more viable for the short term. You need to think about that.
   * How appropriate is the storage facility for the things you want to store?
      * Do you need special conditions to store your things?
      * Keep in mind that nothing is stopping you from using more than one storing option depending on the nature of the thing to be stored.

### Different methods of storage

* **Common methods**  

   * A. Self-Storage  

      * Self-storage is a service that allows individuals to rent secure and convenient storage units when they need to store their goods.
      * Our recommendation for self-storage in the UK is Big Yellow. We have used it and it is good.
      * Pros
      * Cons

&#x200B;

* B. Leave with friends or family  

   * This is when you simply ask friends or family to keep your things while you are having your digital nomad life.
   * There are slightly different ways in which you can use this option. These are: you can ask for them as a favor, borrow them things or pay to store with them.
   * Pros
      * It is most likely free, no monthly fees to pay
      * It is very safe (especially if you leaving your things with family)
   * Cons
      * It can be difficult for you to store large items.
      * It might be embarrassing for you to keep the items too long with friends and family.
      * If something happens to some of your things you most likely won’t be able to complain since they might be doing you a favor.

&#x200B;

* **Unusual methods**  

   * C. Subletting a flat  

      * This is when you rent a flat under your name and you rent it to someone else ""furnished"" with your things.
      * Pros
      * Cons

&#x200B;

* D. Buying/renting a cheap space  

   * This is when you rent or buy a cheap property to store your things.
   * There are slight variations of what you can buy or rent. For example, you can get a commercial property, a residential property, or even a container.
   * You should probably buy or rent a property in the outskirts of your town since such areas are much cheaper and you don’t need constant access to your things once you start your digital nomad life.
   * Pros
      * This option tends to be cheaper than self-storage options if you have a lot of things to store. Even in the case of buying, if you consider the longer term, it might be a better deal.
      * More options in terms of insurance if compared to self-storage. Also, you can choose to have no insurance whatsoever.
      * In the case you buy a property, you will have cheap ongoing monthly fees (e.g. property tax).
      * You can customize the storage place as much as you want (e.g. control temperature, air purifier, extra security, etc. )
   * Cons
      * In the case of buying you will have an upfront investment.
      * Some sort of logistical management (e.g. see if things are in order, pay bills) is necessary once in a while.
      * You can’t change space so easily if necessary.

&#x200B;

* E. Sharing economy solution  

   * There are some websites that allow you to rent extra spaces from private individuals.
   * You can think about this service in terms of the “Airbnb of storage”
   * Services we heard other nomads talking about, but we never tried:
      * UK: Store Mate
      * USA: Neighbor

### Nomad Tactics recommendation

* If you want a quick and easy solution we would most likely still go with the traditional self-storage due to its convenience.
* If self-storage in your city is too expensive then we would consider renting extra space in the outskirts of town.
* The very valuables things we would suggest to leave with your family.

We also place this topic within the first step of our Digital Nomad Life System, which is a 6 steps system that aim to help people live a optimized digital nomad life. In this step, we explain the actions someone needs to take beforehand to optimally transition from a normal stable life to a digital nomad life. There are many areas we will cover in this step of the system. The main areas being finances, logistics, and psychology.

mlrtsj,,South Korea vs Vietnam,"Hi,

I've lived in the southern part of South Korea for a couple years before and, since I am planning on going back abroad, have been considering it vs Vietnam a lot. I wonder if the people who have lived in both countries can tell me about some of the major differences. I enjoyed my stay in Korea before but have never been to Vietnam.

I am also curious about the air. People keep saying that Vietnam (I am looking at Ho Chi Minh City) has much worse air but whenever I compare it to Korea in actual air quality (especially where I lived. Using Air Quality Health Index as my metric) I haven't actually noticed any difference? Is the case, or is the air in Vietnam a lot worse than Korea (I never noticed any issues in Korea to be honest).

Appreciate the input."

I've been thinking about where to go and travel soon, after the vaccine and things are open again, and I kind of feel like I'm not as motivated as I was before to travel or even move location.

I feel like I won't enjoy it that much or that I'm less excited about it than I was before, it's like motivation is low and it feels like it won't be worth it, but, I know sometimes the brain plays tricks on you and doing something feels different from what you think it'll feel when you're just trying to predict it. It just feels like the world is ""less special"" now, everyone's doing the same thing, everyone's online and everything's becoming the same everywhere.

Could it just be my personal pandemic depression? Or, could it be that the pandemic actually made people (not just me) more blasé about traveling?

mm90lp,6edhx,What was your transition to the nomad life?,"I've recently landed a remote job that will allow me to travel, and the nomad life is something that's always appealed to me. I'm curious to hear what other people's experience in this transition was like. 

How did you decide the first place to go was?

Did you immediately shove all your stuff in storage and take off? Or did you start with shorter stays in places within your home country, or a short flight away?

When did you decide to become a full time nomad, or why did you decide against it?

I'm currently leaning more towards having a home base but regularly taking month long work-cations where I work from a new destination for a while, but doing that is definitely more expensive since it means maintaining rent even while not there for long periods. Just wanted to hear about other people's experiences since the amount of opportunity here can be fairly overwhelming.

mmcnun,214lfyrt,Question: how important is the “essential reasons” requirement?,"Hi,
Together with wife we decided to try out best with digital nomad lifestyle and move to Portugal for at least a half of year. The flight is in four days and we started overthinking everything. And we have doubts. 

We’re from another European country so we thought we’re safe but one thing doesn’t let us sleep well. There’s this requirement of having essential reasons to enter Portugal mainland. Before we considered it as a “empty statement”, you know, something that nobody cares about. But the sooner the trip is the more worried we are. 

So, I’d like ask you: how it is? Can we, for example, lie and say we’re travelling for professional reasons? Do we need to prove it somehow? Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want to fool anyone. We probably made a mistake of planning a trip on April but we simply want to spend some time in beautiful country. That’s all."

mrabyq,4x14j7n9,How I find gyms on the road as a digital nomad,"Hi, it's Jack from Nomad Tactics,

Before Covid, I like to go to gyms when I travel. Part of the reason is because of the health benefits and the other part is I like the environment of gyms.

So the other day, me and B (the other guy from Nomad Tactics) were talking about going to the gyms while travel. You know, the good old days. And again, we tried to list every possible way.

Here, we do exclude the option of home workout or yoga. We focus strictly on the gyms.

General considerations about how to go to the gym while traveling

* Always ask to see the facilities of the gym (either by photo, video, or in-person) before committing to a gym membership. Gym facilities quality change widely from country to country.
* Two situations where we think you do not need to bother finding a gym
   * Very short trips (if you are staying less than a month in a place)
      * Reasons why you should not look for a gym during a short trip
      * What if you stay short in a place and you still want to go to the gym, what to do?
   * You have a small budget
      * Going to the gym as a digital nomad can be quite an expensive enterprise if you want to do it consistently around the world.
      * This is mostly because short-term contracts (few months) or day passes tend to be expensive.
      * If you want a safe budget to afford the gym around different cities in the world we recommend you set aside 100 dollars per month. Even though probably in most cities you will pay less than that per month.

Methods to find a gym on the road

* Local gyms
   * You can look for a local gym (either a local gym chain or an independent local gym) and get a monthly membership there.
   * The longer you stay in a city the easier it will be to negotiate the price down.
   * Always prefer independent gyms, rather than chain gyms, because these tend to offer more flexible conditions, like contract length, and it is easier to negotiate the price down. This is not to say that you cannot negotiate with local gym chains. You totally can.
   * How to find local gyms
      * Your best bet is searching through a maps app
      * You can ask the front desk from a hotel near your accommodation (even if you not staying in the hotel) for gyms around… many times they have the information.
      * Finally, you can ask local digital nomads groups on Facebook for gym recommendations. Since going to the gym is a common thing you will surely get some suggestions.
* Accommodation gyms
   * You can find accommodation (Airbnb or hotel) with a gym.
   * Even if you not staying in a hotel with a gym (which is most likely the case if you are staying long in a base) you can still try to use the gym from the hotel by negotiating with the reception desk.
   * Keep in mind that Airbnbs with a gym (which are usually condos or apartment complexes) tend to be quite pricy.
   * Do not expect amazing gym facilities from accommodation with gyms.
* Global gym chains
   * These are global gym chains that have gyms in many cities around the world. You will be paying a monthly membership (which usually is not that cheap) that allows you to go to any of their gyms around the world.
   * These global gym chains are not in every city, so you need to check before you go to your new base.
   * Even when the global gym chain has a gym in your soon-to-be new base you should probably search the exact location of the gym first and then book an accommodation that is somehow near it afterward.
* Public sports centers
   * Not the type of facilities that are available in all countries, but worth checking if available in your base.
   * Usually, these are larger sports complexes that also have a gym.
   * Do not expect amazing gym facilities.
   * The best way to find this kind of place is by researching on Google maps (or any other relevant maps app) for “sports complex” or ask locals about it.
   * The good thing about this kind of gym is that usually these are very cheap, and you pay on a day-by-day basis. Even if you go there every day, it won’t be a big sum of money at the end of the month
* Honorable mention
   * Airbnb-style global gym finder
      * Services that allow you to find a gym in a city and pay for a daily pass, or even, hourly pass.
   * There is still no global solution, but there are promising websites on the horizon

Nomad Tactics Recommendation for how to go to the gym while traveling

* Option number one should still be looking for a local gym since this is the most reliable method.
* If you are a digital nomad that likes to stays in capitals or big cities the global gym chains are also a good solution.
* If you want to try to save as much money as possible look for gyms in public sports centers

I am about a 30% coffee snob, so Nescafe instant coffee won't cut it as a daily, but I don't need my beans freshly delivered to me by donkey at sunrise. As I start to whittle down my life into a backpack and a suitcase to eventually embrance and embark on the r/digitalnomad life - what should I do about keeping my caffeine habit afloat? Do you travel with an Aeropress and a manual coffee grinder or have you had pretty good luck finding solid coffee locally?"
mrj4fq,5nfejxwe,Travelers of which country did you find to be the chattiest?,"
***NOTE, I'm asking about other tourists/travelers you encountered on your travels. Not locals (people on their home turf).***

By chattiest I mean more inclined to approach total strangers to strike up a conversation and more easygoing/receptive to be approached. I guess you could say extroverts...but there are many cultures where their people are very extroverted but only with their own. I'm talking about people who are outgoing and engaging with strangers regardless of their background.

And which were the opposite?!"
mrljki,5hufsszi,How to avoid loneliness as a nomad?,"Background: I have travelled alone since a young age and have always appreciated the independence, flexibility and spontaneity of solo travelling. I usually do one to two week immersions in countries, taking some language classes, living in host families etc. 

Due to COVID, my school is now fully online (like everyone’s else) so it gave me some more opportunities to do longer stints abroad. I would spend a month there and here. However, I am increasingly realizing how lonely I get on these longer teleworking stretches. 

I love discovering the local culture and am grateful for the opportunity to do so, but it feels empty, at the end of the day, being by myself all the time. 

Of course, I meet a good amount of interesting people and these people are the highlights of my trip but there will be days at a time when I don’t have interpersonal interactions deeper than ordering food or small talk. Then, I feel sort of depressed and unbearably lonely. 

Now, I have the possibility of doing a remote internship for the summer and travel during it. I would usually be very excited about this but now I sort of dread it. 

The question: how do you, as digital nomads, get your fill of deep interpersonal interactions and meaningful relationships while you are moving from place to place and staring at a computer all day? What are some useful techniques (I am already extroverted and initiate conversations)?

Thank you!!"
mru4ks,13in6b,Which nomad careers can I start with a master's in economics and management? Is R a good skill for nomad jobs?,"Hi everyone, first time poster here. A little bit of background before the questions:

Italian citizen. I have a Bachelor's in Political Science which is next to useless. I know four languages fluently (Italian, English, French and Spanish) which allows me to find jobs only in customer service as of now. I don't want to do this my entire life and a Master's in Political Science is not the right path for going nomad. Therefore, after some search , I found a reliable MSC in Economics that I can take which allows to start several types of careers. I didn't find much information about the nomad careers, also searching the past posts, so I'll ask here.

Question 1: does anyone here have a similar master's and work in a remote position in this field? Some of the careers I've seen from alumni are audit, management, project management, buyer and procurement. The few people I've known with a similar degree are not nomads.

Question 2: one of the exams is entirely about the programming language R. Half of the exam is theory and the other half is practice. Is R enough to get a good paying job to start with? I'm thinking minimum 30k euros net per year. Do I need to learn other languages to complement R, such as Python? I have several courses on Udemy I just need to start.

Extra question:

Does anyone live in Cyprus? For travelling purposes it seems like the best option (only 60 days of residence needed for tax purposes) but I want to get some first hand experience. Most nomads I know are based in their home country or the country of their partner.

Thank you in advance and have a nice day!"

mrwxgh,2lw98ihk,Airbnb just blocked my account from booking entire places alone out of nowhere,"Hello,

I have been traveling while working remotely for over 2 years now, basically living in different airbnbs long term. I am a solo traveller. I have booked probably over 20 places that are entire homes by myself without issue over the course of using airbnb.

Just tonight, I tried to make a booking request, which was then cancelled by airbnb. Here is some text from the email:

I am writing to let you know that we have canceled reservation (res code). We’re sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.

Our team is committed to your safety, and we have implemented procedures to review reservations with a pattern of activity that may pose a heightened risk to our community. For example, last minute reservations of large homes may trigger additional review.

After a full review, we have determined that we are no longer able to support this reservation.

As a reminder, the Airbnb Community Standards outline the expectations that we have for our community. The Airbnb Authenticity standard prohibits parties without permission and prohibits users from misrepresenting their identity.

I received this email less than one hour after making the request. I called customer support, and the answer I got was that this was basically airbnbs attempt to stop parties, and that my account is blocked from booking an entire home alone.

I am writing this email from an airbnb, that is an entire place, that I have booked alone. I have never encountered this issue before, nor had a party or anything to throw a flag in this direction. I have read that airbnb has blocked some young users from booking entire places at the last minute for short times close to where they live. I am 28, from the USA, the booking is in Mexico, for 35 nights, starting more than one week away.

The only answer that I got from airbnb was that this is handled by a specialized department, and that she will escalate the issue to them, and give it high priority. She doesn't know when I will hear back from them, and all that she said was that in the meantime I can only book a private room in a shared space or a boutique hotel.

I totally depend on booking entire places for long term and this would be a major blow if I am unable to do so. I am hoping that the conflict will be fixed soon, but in the mean time I have no place to stay next week and I need to continue working remotely, I cannot afford to live out of hotels. 

As digital nomads, I am sure that alot of you have also been booking entire places alone. Has anyone come across this issue? If it is not resolved I have no idea what I will do or where I will stay as I have depended on Airbnb for over 2 years as a nomad.

Thanks"
ms3i7w,44fn5a1b,Egypt have been the worst place for me as a Nomad!,"I've been combining work/travel since 2014 and have been staying in one place at least 3 weeks. I live in Helsinki and getting to travel nowadays a bit tricky, so I chose a country with less restrictions where I could get some sun as well after dark winter in Finland.
Egypt Sharm El-Sheikh seems nice and hotels are cheap compared to other places, especially with All Inclusive options where you don't have to think about what or where to eat.
Weather have been great actually and beaches were worm with a pure water.
You might think OK if Weather is great, Hotels are cheap so how it could be a bad experience for a Nomad?
The thing is that almost everyone that I've seen threats you as a money bag and you have to constantly be aware that they try to get maximum out from you. Even in the Airport I bought SIM card which supposed to be charged with 32GBs of internet, but in reality it were just 6GB, and it were an official stand of Vodafone not just some random thing on a corner.
Even when I've been in Bali or Brazil I haven't seen this kind of systematic robbery like in Egypt.
Another extreme example is that Police stopped our taxi and told that we have to pay 20$ of fine because our driver wasn't wearing mask but we have been wearing 🤯 We refused to pay and they just let us go, I wonder how many tourists are went to that trap and paid policeman for that garbage.

Overall I stayed in Sharm El-Sheikh and Dahab a bit more than 3 weeks and it were super uncomfortable starting from Internet (there is no unlimited plan) ending just walking on a street. Had the worst experience with local people.

Wil try out visiting Egypt again in thr future, hopefully it is just me having a bad experience."
ms710h,585cnblp,"Nomads in Spain on Non-Lucrative Visa that have a remote job from the US, what do you do about taxes in Spain?","Hi there,

I already have a non-lucrative visa and I resided in Spain for 6 months (half of which I worked remote). I moved back to the USA for a new job and now want to head back and renew my visa for 2 years, but I am once again a remote worker.

I have enough funds to renew my visa, but the issue is that if I file a Spanish tax return and show income from a company, will I lose my visa?

How do you NL-visas handle this or what is your experience?

Update: I’ve been getting a lot of messages regarding this post, so I’m going to update where I’m at.

I was approved for my 2 year residency visa a few months ago after being in Spain for 6 months. I went through an immigration lawyer that goes through different channels for the renewal, and there was nothing regarding remote work… loophole 1.

I didn’t file taxes the first year and I’m unsure if I will file this year. I will talk to a Spanish tax lawyer to determine what to do, but just like the IRS the minute you file a tax return, they have you. As a non-lucrative you’re kind of in a grey zone.  Loophole 2.

I’d recommend not worrying about taxes the first year. You can always file a retro-active tax form later when you renew. Since the renewal process doesn’t mention anything about working remote I’m sure you can file taxes the next year above board. Loophole 3.

As for getting the visa for the first year… as long as you have the funds in your account to qualify just don’t let them know you’re working remote. No one is going to check up on you, and you’re spending all that money in their economy. Maybe have a bank account which doesn’t show direct deposits from your employer.

Spains laws are contradictory and out of date . Portugal next door does a much better job with remote visas I hear."

I have some coding experience from college but mostly in engineering-heavy languages: FORTRAN (I had an old professor), Matlab (if you can call it a programming language), and C#.

- Do any of the languages I have experience in translate into a remote development career?

- What languages best translate into a remote career? (I think I know the answer to this one, Javascript and python, but let me know if I'm wrong!) What certs should I try to get?

- How long should I expect the educational transition to be? 

- Can I start working remotely immediately once I'm qualified or does one typically need to start at an office job first for a few years?

Things I look for in our next city would be (from most important to least):

\- Safety (petty crime is ok, but I don't want a place where someone pointing with a gun at you is not that uncommon)

\- Ideally where we could live by with english or spanish

\- Not very expensive taking taxes into account (with my salary I would like to be able to rent an apartment, have a car if needed, dinner out once a week at least, travel once in a while)

\- Ideally having a beach or lakes very close to home

\- Good health system

\- Beautiful medium-big city

\- Variety of Cafes/Bars/Restaurants

\- Weather (not too cold, not too rainy)

\- Good connections to airports and other destinations

 

Based on that, I have found these two possible cities:

\- San Sebastian, Spain

\- Dublin, Ireland

mtatv6,h0t3q,"2021 international travellers, how was it?","I'm a Brit (in citizenship and residency) currently in Portugal. My current situation has changed a little over the last month because of 1) UK leaving the EU, and 2) flight availability. I moved into the Schengen zone last summer without issue thanks to the Withdrawal Agreement.

Now, because of Covid, I've been unable to leave despite going over the 90 day in 180 Schengen restriction. The authorities in Portugal say that's fine as: ""you do not need a visa or further authorisation to stay in Portugal longer than 90 days, once you were exercising your right to free movement"" ... ""You should consider flying back as soon as the restrictive measures are lifted""

Some Portugal-UK flights for essential reasons are resuming but I've no interest in returning to the UK. No home, expensive, lower quality of life. I don't think I need to be leaving Portugal right away, but quite frankly the uncertainty of how long I can or can't stay is impacting my concentration, motivation, and thus my work. The rules change every 2 weeks and as such, I have kept extending my Airbnb and car hire. Now I want to go somewhere I know I can stay without issue for 90+ days without worry.

I don't know the process of border control currently in place, hence asking here. If the Reopen Europe site/IATA sites are accurate, then I think Turkey, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, and some South American countries are the best bets? Has anyone flown to any of these this year, or to elsewhere with success? I know Thailand has quarantine hotels but I can't stomach the cost right now.

mtgwst,,My algorithm to find undervalued cities,"So I was trying to come up with some possible destinations to be a digital nomad in and I always end up evaluating to many criteria. So I came up with the following equation to help narrow this down a bit and evaluate good city candidates.  I would like to know what this board thinks 

Country infrastructure rating found here. https://www.statista.com/statistics/264753/ranking-of-countries-according-to-the-general-quality-of-infrastructure/ 

Divided by cost of living index found here https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings.jsp

The reason I use infrastructure rating is reliable Internet is factored in which is a critical concern, but typically areas with great infrastructure offer a good quality of life. This is just a general rule of thumb and of course exceptions exist 

The reason for cost of living is you want to get the most out of your dollar. Not all of us have infinite money :)

For example, if you wanted to compare London vs Singapore you would get this for London (88.9/86.75 = 1.025) vs (95.4/85.59 = 1.115) so Singapore would be the better choice. This of course doesn’t factor in culture or weather so I think it’s just used as a first round filter or tie breaker. What do you guys think?  Am I on to something or is this worthless?"

TL;DR first: US based - Playing with the idea of spending 6-12 months in Europe doing 1-2 month stays in each place with a 1 year old baby. Any advice or tips on booking apartments or managing visa restrictions (assuming this is post covid)?

——

A little background on me. I’m a US citizen, work a remote job, and vaccinated. My wife and I have done a 3 month trip in Europe before but did super short 3-4 day legs in each city or country in the past pre-baby. 

Now we’re considering doing a bit longer of a trip but want to do longer 1-2 month stays in each location to get a feel of what it’s like to live in different cities/countries. We think it’ll make traveling with our young baby a bit easier too. 

My job and stuff isn’t an issue but was looking for advice on logistical stuff. A big plus to anyone with advice regarding bringing a baby. 

Housing - I’ve only used airbnb in the past because we were only staying a few days. Is that still the best option or are there better short term lease tools?

Healthcare - my assumption is that we’d pay for any healthcare out of pocket as foreign nationals 

Travel - any glaring no-no’s with EU’s budget airlines and a baby? We’d have some checked gear nowadays (stroller/pack-n-play/car seat)

mubqjm,bgy1tr67,Graduate degrees?,"Hey everyone,

I see that most people here are software developers, or proficient in multiple languages, etc. I am very interested in the digital nomad lifestyle, however don't have any background in the dominant fields that allow for this lifestyle. 

Starting in 2022, I was planning on using my GI Bill to obtain an online MBA, and between my guaranteed housing allowance, savings, and credit card miles, this would provide me with enough to live the digital nomad lifestyle as a student or a couple of years. But once I finish my degree, it's back to regular life. 

Is there a graduate degree that I could go for instead that could realistically lead to being able to work remotely, while making more than an English teacher or data entry? Particularly for people with no IT background?

Thanks"

mv64f3,ynp8v,Who to talk to regarding setting up a trading company offshore?,"Hey guys,

I'm a Canadian citizen with currently Canadian residency and I am interested in starting a small hedge fund that involves handling the money of clients and pooling them together in order to invest.

I spoke to a corporate lawyer and I was told that once there is trading on exchanges and money changing hands then I would have to get licensed which adds a lot of friction.

I am not trying to evade paying taxes. I am perfectly content running the company from Canada and paying corporate taxes on the profits. The goal would be to bypass the stringent regulations around starting a hedge fund. 

My question is, does the law of treating a 'Controlled Foreign Company' as a local one end at tax purposes? So, for example, the company would be in Singapore and it would handle the deposits/withdrawals between US/Canadian entities in Singapore. Because of CFC laws and my Canadian residency, I would be getting taxed as if the company were in Canada. But would the company also be treated as a local one and face potential action from Canadian regulators for providing services that require a trading license?

If it's possible, who do I need to talk to regarding setting this up?"

mwwmce,,Neuroscientist looking for some specific advice on how to transition to Digital Neuro-Nomad,"So maybe this is just a dream and the possibility doesn't exist, but I am trying to look for a way to change my life to incorporate most of my interests and skills. My main goal in life is to travel to learn from different cultures, learn how to cook different cuisines, experience different ways of life, and see as much as the world has to offer. This pandemic is helping me crystalize my goals, but I still feel like I don't know where to go from here, except that I want to become more flexible in where I live and work so I can travel more.

I'm currently 31. I received a PhD in Neuroscience while living in the US, and moved to Munich, Germany for a postdoc where my contract ends in 10 months, and I'm trying to find out what to do afterwards. Many people in my situation would do another postdoc at a different university in hopes of eventually becoming a professor, or move to industry, possibly for a biotech or pharmaceutical company. I have considered consulting, but I don't know if this is the kind of travel because many consultants say they don't have time to enjoy the places they travel to. I like Germany and Europe, and maybe it's only this pandemic making everything seem worse here than the US, UK, NZ and Australia, but I just feel like I really want to move somewhere new. We had flights bought for ""the trip of a lifetime"" planned for March 2020 to Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam that we canceled last minute, hoping to push it back a year but it still hasn't happened, and it's been very difficult for me to let go of this. 

A summary of my skills: I used multifractal analysis to study how THC impairs working memory by altering hippocampal neuronal activity. I know how to build and implant electrodes in rodent brains. I have published a few peer-reviewed papers in various scientific journals and enjoy scientific writing. I use Matlab and Python to analyze neuronal spike train data recorded from rodents performing memory and navigation tasks. I am learning to analyze LFP data, and starting a collaboration analyzing EEG data. I had a few programming classes and some good mentors, but am primarily self-taught. I teach courses in Python programming now at my university to bachelor's and master's students, and I am creating a Neuropharmacology course to teach starting in 6 months to teach masters and doctoral students. 

I am very interested in neuropharmacology, and would love to study the effects of cannabinoids and psychedelics on the brain in humans and in different cultures, but besides the traditional academic route, I don't know if other opportunities for this exist or where to find them. I think it would be really cool to take an EEG with me to record from people in different places to study the effects of drugs or meditation on different cognitive measures, such as learning and memory. **I ideally would like to combine my neuroscience and pharmacology experience with a nomadic lifestyle, hence ""digital neuro-nomad,"" but don't know where to begin.** 

I also invested in cryptocurrencies last year and made some money. I'm already trying to learn more about trading as a source of income, but it is very unstable and I would not want to rely on this, so I need a more reliable income source. I like teaching and have considered teaching English, but I would love to teach Neuroscience or Pharmacology, but I don't think there's a market for that (unless I can somehow create one). I'm going to sign up on VIPKIDS, which I saw recommended in another post.

Finally, and most *importantly*, I'm married and want my South American wife to be able to join me. Has anyone else done a nomad career with a significant other? We don't have any kids yet but are planning to have them sometime in the future, so I feel like I want to start traveling as soon as the pandemic situation allows, and after my contract ends I hope to find a way of doing this ideally while working. I'm not sure how long I would want to do a nomadic lifestyle, if it works I could consider doing it for years or maybe forever, but I think I'd want to start with at least 6-12 months, so I hope to find something where I could apply my current skills and even learn something new in the next few months while still fulfilling my contract.

mxdf6u,bk3cx6gu,Blender that I use everyday - take with me or re-buy as I travel?,"50% of my daily calories comes from shakes I make with my trusty NutriBullet Pro. I will be checking in luggage (I'm not quite the DN minimalist pro yet), so I can fit in the blender quite easily. However, I will also likely be staying for 6 months at a time in most places I go, which is a long enough time to justify buying a cheap blender per trip as well. For those of you that make a lot of shakes, and use blenders that can pulverize ice/vegetables/frozen fruit, do you usually just buy one when you get to your destination or do you travel with your blender? Is it hard to find decent blenders that aren't too expensive in most locations?

 \[EDIT\] The general consensus and takeaways:

1. Consider the destination voltage. Unlike DC/cattery based devices, something like a blender with an AC motor will likely be pretty dependent on its designed voltage. To make a 110V operate in a 220v country will require a pretty robust voltage transformer. If the voltages are different, it will likely be a lot easier just to buy one in your destination. Be considerate of your waste generation and donate/sell blenders you don't take with you. Or better still, perhaps gift it to the AirBnB for future nomad.

2.  Consider a USB blender like a BlendJet since they are compact and will likely work with a bigger voltage range. They may not blend as well, so consider your blending needs."

mxqmhw,6aeu8,What kind of headset do you bring when traveling for work?,"Let's say you're going to:

1) Listen to an audiobook during a 12+ hour flight.

2) The next day, commute from your hotel to an office, where you'll spend 8 hours straight on conference calls and client calls.

Wired earbuds tend to have crappy, inconsistent microphones that aren't appropriate for long client calls.

Wireless earbuds have limited battery life (Apple Airpods Pro only work for 5 hours straight), and add charging hassle.

Full headsets with boom microphones are kind of bulky for commuting to an office, and take up a lot of space in a shoulder bag.

I'm thinking of getting a splitter (turns 2 TRS plugs into 1 TRRS plug), a lavalier microphone (TRS plug), and earbuds without mic (TRS plug).  It would take minimal space in a shoulder bag (can even carry in a pocket), can plug into smartphone or laptop, and wouldn't have any battery life issues.

mxxjlr,16cavi,"I'm a programmer, but I'm looking for employment opportunities for my partner. Like a VA or TEFL with flexible hours.","My wife and I are looking to go remote next year in September 2022. I have spent the last few years learning software/web development and I currently work as a developer, with which I am hoping to take remote by that stage.

My wife works now and mostly always has worked in hospitality or office admin, she is lovely, bright, an amazing communicator and people love her and love dealing with her in all aspect of her life, but she is a bit lost as to what to do and has never felt terribly motivated to study.

At this point I am hoping that my income will probably be mostly ok for the 2 of us, but I am hoping to get some ideas for options for her to contribute and still have a flexible schedule. I've looked at some places like VIPKid etc and teaching might be an option, but she (we) do not have a bachelors degree that some of these places are asking. A TEFL cert is achievable without too much issue I'd say, but I'd hope we could have some flexibility for hours to travel. Also, I think she'd be great as a virtual assistant if she could find the right kind of work with some regular work opportunities.

I guess I just want to know if regular and flexible work is available if you're a hard working native English speaker with great admin and people skills?

Am I being too worried about how this will work? Is $2k USD that hard to achieve between 2 people?

Especially if my job goes south for whatever reason.

Any ideas gang?"
mxzmoj,5gp6l1fm,Selina CoLiving WiFi any good?,"I need to leave the US preferably to somewhere in central/South America and need very good WiFi for video conferencing roughly 3 hours a day or more. 

I traveled through Mexico for months and never found reliable WiFi except at this one Selina hotel in puerto Escondido. I am afraid to wing it and end up somewhere with poor WiFi so am willing to pay the price for a coliving space like Selina. 

I am wondering if anyone has stayed at any Selina locations and if the WiFi was stable for you? Or know if any other coliving spaces in Latin America that I can count on. I work Monday through Friday so can’t really afford to be jumping from place to place finding decent WiFi, need to be stable and reliable.

Thank you friends"

I am the owner of a vineyard approximately 8000sqm and it is located in Cyprus. I am thinking to transform it into a digital nomad's village.

Seeing the shift from a static place to work to a more remote working lifestyle, I was thinking if the idea that I will describe below could have demand which will drive it to success. So your feedback will be really valuable.

The way I am thinking this village will include: 

5 geodomes in which will accommodate 2 persons, with toilet and a small kitchen along with a fireplace and a small vineyard with a table outside.

One large geodome for lunch and meeting places. In this space, you will have laundry services and a BBQ place.

The cost will be 800usd per month including (water, electricity, and internet)

Will you be interested to be the first tenant of such a place? 

Thanks for your feedback! Any suggestions are welcome.

I have 6 years of experience as a programmer and around 4 years as a full time Java developer. Mainly JavaEE, MongoDB, RabbitMQ and Docker.

myi2s2,3tanmpps,Working Remotely in Mexico Advice?,"Hey All,
This forum has been quite helpful in providing guidance, advice, and recommendations of how to efficiently work remotely. This would be my first experience working remotely.

I plan on working remotely for the month of August and need to be within the EST timezone (give or a take a few hours is fine). The most important factors that I would like to be cognizant of while working remotely are: Good, reliable WiFi. Opportunity to socialize with others. Be near a beach.
Being from NY, I'm trying to avoid big city vibes intentionally.

I did some research and am learning towards Playa Del Carmen and Tulum (maybe Costa Rica?). What do you guys think? PDC does seem to be noticeably cheaper than Tulum.

I do like the Selina & Outsite locations in these places and with their CoWorking space, that might ensure I get strong Wifi. Has anyone stayed at one of these?

Open to suggestions in other cities as well. Thanks!"

myne1f,45mkp,co-living/working programs,"I am interested in finding coliving/coworking sites designed for digital nomads. I have come across a few, and was hoping to learn about any other similar programs and discuss their pros and cons. To keep comparisons fair, all prices listed are for a private sleeping space, standard tier where possible. Ones I have come across:

* [Selina](https://stay.selina.com/colive/): Network of many hostels that are tailored to DNs and have attached coworking space. Particularly prominent in Latin America, but also in US and Europe. The ""colive"" program lets you book by month and travel between their many locations. I have been pretty happy with the few that I have been to. Generally much nicer than your average hostel. My one complaint is that they tend to lean towards party over practicality. For example they tend to play loud music very late, which could get annoying when staying for a month or more.
price: ~ $1,100 - $1,500 / month for standard room, depending on location tier

* [Remote Year](https://www.remoteyear.com/program-type-worktravel): Community-based work/travel programs for 1, 4, or 12 months. They find the group housing and local experiences, and provide workspaces, which it looks like are often the local Selina coworking space.
price: ~$2850 / month

* [Umaya](https://www.umayavillage.com/digital-nomads): Belize beach resort turned wellness-focused DN community. 
Price: $1500 / month

* [Outsite](https://app.outsite.co/): “Coliving spaces, community, and perks designed for remote workers and creatives. It combines beautiful destinations with reliable workspaces, fast Wifi, like-minded communities and everything you'll need for a comfortable stay”. The pics look really nice, and the comments I've found are all positive.  Has anyone had experience with them?
Price: ~$1,100 - 2,000 / month

* [Wifi Tribe](https://wifitribe.co/): work/live travel community, subscribe and join trips with 12-25 people. Appears to be focused on nature adventure: hiking, camping, mountain biking, etc. $500 annual membership plus $1,000-$1,500 per month for the trips. (credit: StarManNova)

* [KoHub](https://kohub.org): Space in Thai island Koh Lanta. Comes with private room, coworking space, two meals a day, local discounts, and lots of other perks. $1,200 (and running a deep COVID discount right now for $723) (credit: Triathlete06)

* [Roam](https://www.roam.co/):  they are on hiatus due to COVID and their website is a bit mysterious as to what it will look like when they come back.

That's what I've got so far. Are there any other programs like these? Are there any particular distinguishing characteristics?"

I'm looking for advice and 'inspiration'. I just got a remote job and obviously I'm super pumped about it, but it's a contractor position, so I'll be handling my own taxes. The thing is: I do not want to pay taxes in my home country. For starters, it has one of the highest tax rates in Europe (or possibly the highest- Around 43% for my salary). Also, I don't live there and I'm not planning to go back there anytime soon. The company I'll be working for is European, but not from my home country.

At the moment, I'm not really planning to settle anywhere long-term. The plan is to stay for a few months in each country (right now I'm in Mexico, Costa Rica is next I think) and maybeeee settle somewhere next year. 

I guess even if I don't live in one country for longer than 180 days I still have to pay taxes somewhere, right? Or how do you do it? What country has low taxes (preferably in Europe I guess) and it's easy to pay taxes there (without permanently living there)?

Many people just move around without even running every country move through their company's legal department, etc.

On the contrary, many companies don't allow you to work from abroad or require extensive reviews to let you do so for say, just 1 week.

If one wants to live the digital nomad lifestyle abroad, while being employed (self employment is a whole different beast) in a high-salary country, does one have to resort to (usually smaller) companies that don't care/worry as much for the legal implications?

n19lug,4x14j7n9,What to Do in the Airbnb Check-in Process,"Hey hello I'm Jack from Nomad Tactics Podcast.

So we did a small series of Airbnb, because we think it is the most popular booking platform out there.

Although the main topic is for Airbnb, I think most of the advice can apply to most rental property.

Here are the things to look after:

1.1. This topic within our Digital Nomad Life System

* The Digital Nomad Life System is a 6-step meta-system created by us at Nomad Tactics that aims to explain how someone can go from living a non-nomadic normal life to living an optimized digital nomad life.
* The forth step of the system is called the “Arriving Process”. This can be understood as the things the digital nomad needs to do once he arrive in your new base (the city you will stay in) to make sure you will be properly settled there in order to make the most out of the stay. **The Airbnb check-in is one of the first things you will need to consider in this step of the system.**
* To have a general overview of the Digital Nomad Life System you should [check out this post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/mcu7ww/digital_nomad_life_system_do_you_guys_think_it/).

1.2. Airbnb Tips for Guests: Before the Check-in

I will start with the best Airbnb tips for guests in terms of the things you should do after you complete your booking but, before you check-in to the property.

This should be done a couple of days before you fly to your Airbnb destination.

A. Ask How to Check-in

Not all Airbnb check-ins were created equal.

**There are different ways in which hosts will ask you to check-in.**

Some of them will ask you to self check-in (i.e. getting the keys from a key box), others will ask you to meet you at the property, and others will ask you to get the keys with a neighbor or the doorman.

Before you get to the property, it is always a good idea to figure out which type of check-in you are dealing with.

This is an important information to acquire because, depending on the type of check-in, you may be more or less flexible regarding the check-in time. For example, if a property offers self check-in then there seems to be no problem getting there at 2 AM straight from the airport. On the other hand, if you need to meet the host then it would be unreasonable for you to ask him to meet at 2 AM for the check-in. Most likely you would need to book a different flight or be ok staying in a hotel for that night.

**Sometimes the type of check-in information is available on the Airbnb listing. But not always. If that is the case, ask the host directly.**

B. Ask the host if the address provided on the Airbnb listing is correct

Somewhere in here, I’m sure

Sometimes, the address provided on the Airbnb listing is wrong.

You might encounter this problem especially when you are trying to import the address from the Airbnb app to Google Maps.

It makes sense to confirm with the host the address before going there.

**Pro tip:** The easiest way to confirm the address is copying and pasting it from the Airbnb app to Google Maps, screenshotting it, and sending it to the host to check.

C. Ask what is the best way to get from the airport to the Airbnb

You should always ask the host the best way to get from the airport to the property.

Advice from locals (in this case the host) will usually be more accurate than information that can be found online.

If the host does not know this information or you want to confirm the information provided by him, then you should use [Rome2Rio](https://www.rome2rio.com/). This is a website primarily used to book flights. Nonetheless, this website also offers a very useful function that shows possible ways to go from the city’s airport to the city center. Rome2Rio is usually more complete than Google Maps in this regard.

D. Tell the Host the Estimated Time of Arrival and Ask Him for a Way to Communicate

Of course this advice only makes sense if the host needs to be at the property for the check-in. If you are going to stay in a self check-in property then you can skip this tip.

You should tell the host the estimated time you will arrive at the property. This can be calculated based on the landing time of your plane and the time you will need to go from the airport to the Airbnb.

Also, ask the host what is the best way to communicate with him. If you get lost on the way to the Airbnb, it is always a good idea to have a way to communicate with your host.

Sometimes the Airbnb app is unreliable for communication. It would be ideal to use an alternative messaging app (e.g. WeChat, WhatsApp, Viber). The specific messaging app will depend on what part of the world you are in.

**Pro tip:** Always consider that you will take about one hour in the airport immigration when you are estimating the time of arrival in the property.

1.3. Airbnb Tips for Guests: During the check-in

These are the best Airbnb tips for guests in terms of the actions that should be done in the actual check-in process.

I will be writing the next section assuming the host himself is with you during the check-in process.

However, if that specific Airbnb has a self check-in system then you can follow the same steps. You will just need to adapt some of the steps to be done over a messaging app rather than in person.

A. Ask the wifi password and test it

Good wifi is crucial for most of us nowadays. Thus, it is essential that whenever you get to a place you test it in front of the host to see if it works well.

If it does not work well then you can ask the host to fix as soon as possible.

B. Ask how to use the washing/drying machine

You would be surprised how different washing/drying machines are around the globe.

It is always a good idea to ask the host how to operate those, especially if the buttons in the machine are in a foreign language

C. Ask how to turn on the hot water

This is surprising to some people but in some places you need to activate a switch to have hot water.

It is a good idea to know if that is necessary for the property you are staying in.

D. Ask how to operate the heater/air-con

This is just like the two previous items on the list.

You should get to know the specifics of how to operate the heating/air-con systems on the Airbnb.

E. Ask about the keys

Usually, the host will handle you more than one key. It makes sense to ask where to use each one (i.e. which one opens the main gate, the house, the letterbox, etc... ).

**Moreover, if you are renting with friends, it makes sense to ask for an extra set of keys.**

F. Shoot a video of the place

Whenever I get to a new Airbnb, I shoot a video of the conditions of the place, especially if there is something on the flat that is already broken.

I do that to protect myself in case the host accuses me of breaking something.

If you have video proof, then his accusation will not go very far.

G. Ask for the location of the “essential” places

There are some kinds of place that almost anyone would benefit from knowing their location.

These are things like supermarkets, pharmacies, public transport hubs, and gyms, etc.

It is always a good idea to ask.

H. Report any problems with the property

When you are checking-in you should look around the whole property and report to the host any problems you encounter.

You should look for problems during the check-in because if there is an issue that the host cannot resolve, then the easiest time to get a full refund, through Airbnb, is within 24h of the check-in.

I'm changing my writing style a bit. Let me know if you like this type of writing or the bullet point style.

Cheers!"

I did some digging into being a digital nomad, and I’m interested in traveling + working remotely within the US for 6 months - 1 year (maybe longer if things go to plan)

I guess I imagine myself visiting a city for 6-8 weeks at a time, working 9-5 ish and exploring the area on the weekends and after work. I’m big into hiking, backpacking, and anything outdoors. 

Am I romanticizing this? I know it can be lonely, stressful, and financially strenuous to be a nomad in the US. I’m just so tired of working remotely in the same place day in and day out. If I’m working from home, I may as well be somewhere new, right?"
n1k5oz,a96ixav8,What countries in south east Asia might open up soon? (If any),"I’m currently in New Zealand if it matters.

My lease is running out in June and my plan was to head into south east Asia for 2-3 months and focus on my career / work from my laptop while enjoying the sun and getaway from my usual life.

Now I obviously don’t want to do anything harmful or ignorant on another countries so likely will be postponing this trip but I wanted to see if anyone knew any countries that are fairly open right now in south east Asia?

n1kgcd,29rc3nbv,Flying tomorrow. Please remind me why we do this?,"The last 14 months I've spent more time at home with family in the US than I have the last 10 years. Thanks, covid.

Got vaccinated. Got my negative PCR. Tomorrow I'm heading back to the EU, and instead of being excited, I feel shit. I will miss my family, they will miss me. 

I always hate this part, and feel no relief until I'm waiting at my gate and on a mission to arrive... 

But after covid, it's harder than ever. 

Can any long-term nomads relate? It's been 10 years for me, living out of a suitcase traveling every few months. I am tired.

Why do we do this again?

-

Edit for more context because I realize I might sound like an ungrateful ass. 

I spent more than a decade working so hard - strategizing and implementing a career path that would make a nomadic life sustainable. I was successful! Travel is now fully baked into my career, my relationships. I'm a dual citizen, so family is in the US, my 4-year relationship is in the EU, and my established production work is on yet another continent. I rotate seasonally. Stopping travel would require dismantling, rebuilding, and risking my entire career, ending a relationship, and saying goodbye to friends and crew members who have become like family after 10 years of experiences together. 

Maybe it sounds like some romantic, jet-setting fantasy life but when you've lived it you realize it's just a whole hell of a lot of neverending goodbyes."
n1mdyh,1xli1vnv,"US citizen, Italian spouse, US company: What are the implications for working remotely?","Hey, all - I’ve been scouring dozens of threads on this matter, but nothing is super clear.

I received a nice offer for a US-based company for a Software Engineering role. I am a US citizen. My spouse is an Italian citizen. Our plan is to split our time between New York (current home base) and Italy.

When I shared this information with the company, they brought it to HR and then even outside counsel. I received this email tonight: “I’m sorry that we will not be able to accommodate that arrangement for a duration as long due to intl labor and taxation questions, and also time zone alignment with the rest of the team.” The latter part is fixable; I simply work NY hours in Italy. However, the former part is what I need help on.

Do I ask if I can be an independent contractor instead?

From what I’ve been reading, if I’ll be in Italy for 6 months or longer, I need a work permit. I don’t see this being a problem since my spouse is Italian.

Any advice on how I might be able to salvage this offer? As mentioned, we will certainly be splitting our time between here (NY) and Italy so can’t change that."
n1nm3t,9hidsn1w,Starting our DN journey during Covid (or not?),"Hey there dear DN community.
My partner and I have been building a freelance career for a couple of years and building skills that allow us nomadic lifestyle for at least 4-5 years while maintaining our daily job.

In the last few months our business kinda reached momentum: lots of clients were coming in and side income is now matching day job income. We both work in digital marketing, so this is surely been inflated by the pandemic.

We also managed to save approximately 3 years of living expenses (in the country we live in).

We are ready to quit our daily job and start our new life, but…Corona is still here.

We are afraid that, given the current situation, we won’t be able to enjoy travel or it will be painful. Our short term plans are to have a little trip in France and Spain before stopping in Portugal for 3-4 months. 

My partner, which is more emotional than me, also think that is not the best time to quit a regular job and everyone around her says it’s risky. 

We are both tired of having 2 jobs at the same time.

What should we do?"
n1rcw8,5a9ktll4,Want to quit my career and travel but so scared," 

Hi there

So this is something that i feel my soul really needs to do, im 28F , have no kids, recently came out of a relationship and have no one depending on me. Been wanting to do this since i was 17.

I do have debt which i am working on paying off my working my ass off in overtime this year, and then have some savings as well.

i have a job that is quite lucrative and allows for me to come back and work again in the field ( it might be difficult but i plan on ending things on good terms at my current post and with my good work ethic i can see myself in the field again) - it might be difficult at first but i have a close cousin that offered for me to crash at her place if i dont have a place to stay so i have that going for me.

My worry is, will i have enough saved to be able to just survive off my savings? I know this sounds cheesy but i want to sit with the monks in Nepal, chant with the shamans in Asia. i want to experience all cosines and various cultures. i want to meet people and really say i LIVED and did it.

But how good is backpacking? am i able to live in hostels when i have lived my entire life in my own apartment with my own luxuries?  
i have read that some people do remote online teaching and still get to work or become digital nomads.  
The idea of earning something while travelling sounds settling but then again i dont want to feel 'stuck' at something i dont like which is my current issue.

So many different thoughts running through my mind which creates so much fear and then makes me doubt myself

However! one thing ive already done was start to pay off my debt and made a spreadsheet to spend my money more wisely.

Any advice from fellow travelers would be HIGHLY recommended!"

n2syvl,3v1bbfdu,Mexican Temporary Resident Visa/*Digital Nomad Visa*," 

\*posting here as well and yes I know it's not officially called a digital nomad visa but many digital nomads and freelancers apply for it so figured I'd check here\*: Sorry for the long post but want to be thorough and I haven't found an answer on reddit or generally to some of my questions and I think it could be extremely helpful for persons if someone is able to answer:

\-**Has anyone applied since Jan-April 2021 and provided bank statements for economic solvency for $1700 USD / month or close to that?** I make about $1850 consistently after tax from remote work and I own my own business, however, because of covid my business has grinded to an almost complete halt. So much so that I wouldn't even consider it a second source of income right now. I have plans to try and pump some life back into it but until the pandemic improves which could be another year or two the most I could see myself earning monthly from it is between $100 and $300 usd. Point is, I hear conflicting figures so if **anyone has a similar income and has gotten approved in 2021 I'd appreciate the feedback** on your application process and interview.

\-**Has anyone applied for it in a country outside of their home country (specifically Colombia, Panama or the USA)?** I'm considering Panama, then the US then Colombia, based on ease of entry + cost of flights, appointment availability etc. My country's official Mexican embassy website had 0 information regarding the process for applying for temporary residency and you can't schedule an appointment on Mexitel for my country either. I will attempt to contact them to see if I can apply in my home country and the requirements (as I hear it actually differs from consulate to consulate and some are more 'lax' or likely to approve than others) but feedback on persons applying outside their home country is extremely welcome e.g. if you're Japanese and applied in Panama.

\-Is it possible to apply with a spouse? I'm not currently married but I do have a long term partner earning around the same as me per month and if we can get married and apply together and possibly reduce the monthly economic solvency amount that would be great. Most info is for persons applying individually and I haven't gotten anything solid regarding applying as a couple or if it's even possible. If it's not, the next best option seems to have one of us apply and then have the other person apply as a dependent of a person with temporary resident visa/card)

I guess to close off I should also add I'm not fluent yet but my Spanish is intermediate and I am currently working on becoming fully fluent. I have been to Mexico before (my country is a part of the visa waiver program + I have a valid visa from one of the applicable countries (US, Canada, UK etc) so I do get the 180 days) but I want to stay here long term. I love Mexico, the cost of living if you know what you're doing is reasonable, I've always wanted to live in another country and I would like to own a home/invest in real estate here someday. There are other reasons but the point is, it's a beautiful country and I'm also aware of the pro's and cons and will be doing a trial visit before making a final decision. So far I'm considering Playa Del Carmen and Querétaro but will be doing research and asking for more advice before I choose a city and visit."

n3kk85,152ktjgd,Help with VPN for remote job.," 

Dear everyone,

I consider myself not an amateur in technology/computer but I still am not an expert, and I would really appreciate if you all can spare your time to help me with this situation.

I live in CA, last month I got an offer for a  job with a local organization in WA. And I specifically asked the recruiter if I could work from home in CA once I successfully finish the training on-site. So I quit my previous job, packed my bag, and left for WA with the hope I can come back after 3 weeks of training.  
And then, foolishly me during the training had to reconfirm with one of the manager and they said the company won't allow you to work in another state due to its policy. And they just simply said sorry for the miscommunication. So they left me with no options but only I chose to resign or not.

So that is why I'm thinking about using VPN to leave my IP in WA just in case. I need to keep this income for at least a month or two before I find myself a better job.

This is just a local organization and I don't get paid extremely well to believe that they will track all of my records and everything. So I was wondering if I could make it work with my IP in disguise? And any experiences, inputs from you guys would be very helpful. My partner is in CA, and at this moment he needs my support so I cannot leave him alone :("

I am sure many people across the world have this same feeling after working remotely for a year during lockdowns. 

For Digital Nomads, moving is second nature but with so many restrictions and lockdowns to keep track of how can you be sure of where to set up your next base?

Many countries are trying to capitalize on this global relocation movement by offering remote work visas. There are even states/cities in the U.S that will pay you thousands of dollars just to stay there for a year.

Will you choose to drink piña coladas on the beach in Antigua and Barbuda or explore centuries-old architecture in Georgia? You could even keep it simple by buying a house for dirt-cheap in Topeka, Kansas.

Here is a list of the 11 countries currently offering a remote work visa and the top 5 cities in the USA that will pay you to move there.

n4rwyl,eskre,Cost of covid testing when traveling internationally?,"I haven't crossed a border since testing became a common requirement, but I'm considering relocating later this year. With vaccine rollout the way it is, I might not be fully vaccinated by then.

I'm having a hard time finding the actual cost of testing in other countries so I'm hoping some of you can share the costs you've encountered on your travels!

Now that I’m in a job that I really like and am really good at, the thought having to stay in one place for a long time and not have to freedom to travel causes me a lot of anxiety that just makes we want to quit altogether. 

Basically I want to ask my boss if it would be possible for me to be fully remote and work from a different country/city (currently in Madrid) with the assurance that I would probably always come back to the office once or twice a month since this is where my family lives.

The reason I think this would be a potential solutions is because the majority of the office is working from home full time nowadays (technically I can to but I go into the office every once in a while), we also have a lot of employees that live in Latin America or other parts of Europe and they make it work (I do work more closely with my boss than others, though). On the other hand though, I am relatively new (under one year) and it would be a big leap of faith for them to trust that I could be traveling around and getting everything done. The startup is also growing quite rapidly and they might prefer someone to be close physically. 

Tl:dr; I need advice on how to leverage my (very un advantageous) position to get my boss to let me work from abroad and present it as a win-win for everyone (I get to be happy and they get better work from  me because of said happiness).

n5p14i,6bm61d4c,High density of nomads right now?,"I'm a software developer working on developer tooling. It's the sort of thing where the ability to have informal conversations over drinks (or surfing, or hiking, or anything) with other nomads - specifically self-employed nomads - is crucial to guiding development. Obviously, during the pandemic, with the lack of meetups, conferences, etc, that sort of thing has become very difficult. So I'm looking to get out! But I'm not just looking for nice scenery. I want to go where the nomads are!

The traditional hotspots - Indonesia, Thailand, etc. are still very restricted. At the very least, I suspect that the level of difficulty in getting in is keeping most people out.

I think we shouldn't unfairly hate a whole group due to the actions of a select few. Period. I've tried to make this point many times over in /bali.

There is a lot of hate on tourists, due to the actions of some idiots. It's true recently there is a lot of ""influencer inbreds"" in Bali and SE Asia. However, due to tough times, I've seen an overall shift of hating not just a sub-group of idiots but instead a whole population of tourists. We are not all the same.

Although this didn't happen in Bali, there will be hate on the locals for this. Is it fair? No! Do these nasty local inbreds correlate to the whole population? Although these actions are super shameful, the answer is absolutely not!

The truth of the matter is we are all one, we are all human. We shouldn't criticize a whole group because of a select few individuals. It's good humans VS. bad humans and that's it. There's no use to look at anything more such as race, occupation, financial worth, etc. The simple fact is every country on the planet has its very own rednecks/bogans -- not all humans are created equal, and more importantly not all humans want to educate themselves.

There are good people, and nasty people EVERYWHERE, and it's not a local vs. foreigner issue we should be fighting around the world--it's uneducated bad people vs. educated global citizens of the world. 

When I talk about education, I don’t mean textbook smarts, I understand that sadly not everyone has access to proper schooling. I’m talking more about education of life, morals, learning right from wrong. Choosing the right but hard way. Learning about other cultures. Etc...

We should collectively fight against bad, not single out foreigners vs. locals as I've been seeing a lot of on the news and several Reddits.

We’ve globalized. Borders have been blurred. If there is one thing I learned from Corona, it’s that going back to a to a less globalized less interconnected world is not one I’d like to be in.

Travelling while working remotely has long been a dream of mine. I’m 27 and currently work full time in marketing and have been working remotely during the pandemic. Unfortunately we will be required to go back in to the office in the next couple months. 

Over the last year I started my own consultancy/agency on the side where I am generating about $1500 USD/month after expenses from a couple clients who have signed long term contracts. I also get a couple one off projects a month that bring in an additional ~$300 month. I would like to put more time into growing my business (while travelling) but can’t do that while working full time.

My question is do you think with my current side income I would be able to work as a digital nomad comfortably or should I wait until I get a couple more clients? I also have about $40K in cash savings and no debt if that helps. 

Thanks

ORIGINAL POST:  
I am slow traveling (mostly Europe) for 3 years now and most often I meet two types of people:

1. extreme specialists, who do not have a clue about how the world works (like physics, biology, social relations, economics, philosophy, etc.). The goal of such people is money and nice sunsets. But money is the priority, of course.
2. extreme ""fake"" generalists, like all the life coaches, spiritual bullshit(beliefs in stark contrast against ordinary psychology), extreme eco-farming while ignoring the reality, etc. Most base their worldview on some weird non-scientific assumptions.

Well, it is kinda a representation of the general population because it is hard/expensive to know a lot with reasonable ""depth"". However, I was working as a research assistant in a university before I started traveling, so my environment was nothing like that. I am missing wide and deep topics that I cannot find ""randomly"" in the world.

Rationality and scientific worldview is what I am seeking... Are there any centers of attraction (like universities) where I could live in nature, but still have such social experiences?"

n7mhhu,2lt2yzdi,[EU] Advice needed on how to travel across Europe and work remotely,"Hi!

&#x200B;

My boyfriend and I are currently living and working full-time in Spain (we're both EU citizens, although from different countries), and we've been thinking of moving away for some time, and one idea we'd like to explore is some kind of ""digital nomad"" lifestyle and traveling to different cities every 2/3 months for 1 or 2 years before settling down in our favorite place. For now, we're happy to only go to countries in the EU to make things simple, at the very least until covid is properly behind us, but who knows when that'll be.

&#x200B;

So I've been reading a lot of stuff on the subject, but there's a lot of information on the topic out there, and like half of it is from guys chilling in Bali ultimately trying to sell you their e-book or whatever, so if you have any advice or resources to consult on the following topic, I'd be super grateful!

&#x200B;

\- I'd like to keep my current job if possible, but I don't know if I need to go the freelance way and can be hired only by them? I'd rather stay a full-time employee of them if possible. I haven't talked about it with them yet, as I'd like to start that conversation once I have a better understanding of the different possibilities.  

\- For taxes, I believe that an ""easy"" way to deal with them would be to stay in Spain for at least half the year to keep being a tax resident there, but then what happens when I'm abroad? For example, say I spend 2 months in France, 2 months in Prague, and the rest in different Spanish cities, do I just not care about the time abroad assuming both countries have tax treaties with Spain, and pay as if I was in Spain the whole time?

\- Regarding health insurance, what's a good way to manage that? Does anyone have experience on the topic? For example, if we stay in the Spanish health system, and get sick after 2 months in Prague, I don't how the health coverage would work. My boyfriend also happens to be diabetic, so that's a whole other topic to deal with.

\- Finally, anyone has some piece of wisdom to give me about going for such a lifestyle with a partner? We've been together for a few years, and have good communication between us, so I'm not too worried about that part, but if you have some advice to give us I'd be very grateful.

n7rf0h,4ffqd2ao,Realistic cost of living in Bangkok,"Since starting to read this subreddit years ago, I have since traveled quite a bit, and have realized how much people exaggerate the affordability of some popular locations. Particularly Mexico City and Bangkok. I find it frustrating when people do this, since it gives the false impression that visitors can really have a high quality of life for a ridiculously low cost.

*""Live like a king on $1000 per month!""* they say.

OF COURSE you can live on $1000/month in Thailand. But as a man in his 30s, who has actual work to do, I value privacy, comfort, and quality of life.

Here are my approximate monthly expenses for basic **short-term** living in Bangkok. Obviously this can be lowered if you have local connections and speak the local language.

**Short term rent: $600** 

SHORT TERM is the key here. Airbnb or hotel, decent location, moderately comfortable with basic amenities. Furniture is likely not very comfortable at this price range. Expect a hard mattress and no office chair (which is surely fine for lots of folks). I've found hotels more comfortable than Airbnbs in Thailand at the same price. Again - SHORT TERM. Signing a several-month contract lowers this price a bit.

**Food: $300**

Daily meals for a typical 2400 calorie diet. Typical mall food court meal is $1.25-$4, depending on how much you eat and if you want meat other than eggs. This is super basic food. Going out to western restaurants will bust this budget quickly.

**Cell/hotspot: $10**

Yeah, this is crazy cheap here.

**Bottled water: $30**

This is drinking about 2 liters a day, and occasional small bottles from the 7-11 while out.

**Health insurance: $40**

Safety Wing or something like that. Just for emergencies.

**BTS tickets: $30**

One round-trip ticket every other day. Assuming you only leave your neighborhood every other day. Realistically I leave it most days, so I spend more than this.

**Grab/Taxis: $30**

For when the BTS is far or it's late, or when you're with a date.

**Visas: $50**

The typical extension cost, plus transport to the immigration office. These are currently cheaper than usual, due to the pandemic eliminating the need for border runs. Many visas cost a lot more than this. 

**TOTAL: $1,090**

**This does not include** any alcohol, dating, coworking, coffee shops, snacks, new shoes, new clothes, electronics, toiletries, vitamins, sunscreen, travel, excursions, or any entertainment outside of your apartment. All of these have been additional expenses that I'm leaving out for the sake of keeping the budget low, and it's still more than $1000. Dating in particular can be expensive here; educated girls seem to expect farangs to take them to nice places.

Note that this is still a VERY BASIC lifestyle. You can get this below $1000/month in some of the smaller cities. Lots of retirees from the UK do exactly that with their pensions, but they don't do much other than stay home and drink at the cheapest bars they can find.

Thailand is great, and it's super affordable compared to western cities. But let's be realistic.

**tl;dr:** Yes, you can live on $1000/month in Thailand. You cannot ""live like a king"" on that budget. $1500/month is pretty comfy though."

Take some courses, volunteer, work remotely for little pay and just get some skills for the next six months as I can live off my savings for a year and a half. I have considered digital marketing and other skills I can look into. I also have some personal house renovations that I will be attending to. Right now finding a next job isn’t an option. Finding myself and purpose is more important.

Here's what I do/have now and what I wish I'd prepped with before starting the travel/nomad thing 

1. Wise (formerly Transferwise) + debit card: Best for transferring money internationally, up to $2000.  If more than $2000, do a straight international wire transfer.  Great addition to a regular checking account (free)


2. Revolut + debit card: Good backup debit card, good in app controls, good for transferring cash to friends.  I recommend only keeping as much cash in the account as you'll use in the next few days. Another addition to a good checking account (free)


3. One premium, travel-friendly credit card (i.e., Chase Sapphire, Citi AAdvantage, AMEX) - for the initial points bonus, travel perks, and customer service (~$95/yr)


4. One simple credit card with no annual fee (i.e., Chase Freedom): Backup credit card for when you have issues with the premium one (free)


5. Two no-fee checking accounts with two debit cards: Charles Schwab is the best, Capital One 360 and Discover Cashback are good options (free)


6. Virtual mailbox: To maintain a single address in your home country, receive mail, and receive scans of mail ($12/mo)


7. 2FA capable SIM (Google Fi is best, T-Mobile One is possible for less than 3 months but not recommended) ($20mo w/o data)


8. Digital Backups of Essential Documents (Passport, DL, Intl. DL, Travel Insurance Card, credit cards) in Google Drive/Gmail (free)


9. Cash (USD or Euros) for 3 days minimum (?)


10. Passport and ID Copies (paper and digital) + original international drivers license


11. Google Drive (backup for personal documents and scans) (free)


12. Travel Insurance (need varies by traveler, and travel style) (~$40/mo)


13. Rental/Personal Property Insurance: Most cover laptops even when traveling (I've had 2 laptops replaced).  Smartphones can be covered but price usually isn't worth it. ($12/mo)


14. VPN: Essential for accessing any banking information, email, or personal docs online. A good one. None of the free or trial services. (~$5/mo)


OTHER PERSONAL FINANCE ACTIONS TO DO BEFORE TRAVEL

13. Call your bank to notify of extended travel before traveling.

14. Setup addresses, phone numbers ( with Google-Fi SIM card) before traveling

15. Carry printed pictures of all of your travel documents and the front and back of all credit  cards

16. Understand your credit card benefits for delays, lost baggage, and accidents during travel

17. Understand your essential rights as an airline passenger according to airline policy and FAA for delayed flights, canceled flights, lost baggage, damaged baggage, overbooking, etc.


I'm curious what measures everyone else takes to limit banking/tax/identification issues during travel.

I also realize my list might only be suitable for people from the US, so I'm curious about the different steps everyone thats not from the US takes .

And there are some horror stories with Wise, Revolut, and some travel insurances - but i use them redundantly so I can rely on their strengths but don't get screwed by their weak points.

So what other tips do the experienced nomads have? And what other tools do you use on the road?

I've posted the longer version of this list of thoughts [here](https://abrotherabroad.com/personal-finance-tools-digital-nomads-travelers-expats/) and I'll add any good tips I hear in the convo as well

**EDITS**

n9bthz,yjo9q,"Digital Nomading, More Than Just 'Pretty Locations and Laptops on Tables'. Our Experience and Thoughts After Four+ Years...","We’ve successfully been digital nomads since 2016. We’re happy, love our lifestyle, and consider ourselves **extremely** fortunate. The DN lifestyle isn’t for everyone, but for those aspiring to become DNs or new to it, we wish you nothing but success! Part of *making it* is realizing that there’s a big difference between **typical** DN reality and the Instagram picture *perfect* DN lifestyle.

Have you ever **really** tried working on a beach, in direct sunlight, or on a bench for 8-12hrs+ a day? There's sand, heat, glare, and poor ergonomics that are all working against you. If you’re like us, you’ll quickly opt for a desk, office chair, and solid internet connection and leave the beach for leisure time.

With that being said, here are **our** thoughts and experiences with life as a DN couple:

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

**Background and Context**

Married couple working, traveling, and house sitting (over 70 sits so far) full-time since 2016. The adventure started when we sold/donated/gave away 95% of our belongings and set off to pursue a goal of traveling Europe for a year. Fast forward to the end of that year and we had the fortune of visiting three continents, 23 countries, and 60 cities all while doing 18 house sits.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

List of countries (in order) we visited during the first year:

* Ireland
* United Kingdom
* Germany
* Netherlands
* Hungary
* Luxembourg
* Belgium
* Turkey
* Switzerland
* Italy
* Vatican City
* Egypt
* France
* Norway
* Romania
* Slovakia
* Austria
* Poland
* Czech Republic
* Greece
* Bulgaria
* Spain
* Morocco

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

**Budget and Expenses**

In the first year of travel we spent $16K all-in. We traveled fast, saw/experienced a lot of amazing things, and made some great friends that we still keep in touch with today.

In the subsequent years we’ve slowed down considerably and have spent $7,500 (traveling North America), and $7K two years in a row while traveling **within the US** (all numbers are for two people). Thanks to house sitting, travel hacking, credit card churning, etc., we’re able to not only travel for pennies on the dollar but **also** increase our savings rate in our pursuit of FI/RE (financial independence, retire early, r/leanFIRE, r/financialindependence).

Living a DN lifestyle in **tandem** with the mentioned life hacks has proven to be more cost effective than staying put and living a traditional life. We've effectively eliminated housing costs and the ancillary costs that come along with it (e.g. water, sewer, trash, recycle, electricity, natural gas, internet, etc.)  we doubt that even geo-arbitraging in SEA or other cheap destinations would save us money.

Since traveling this lean isn’t realistic for most people **be** **proactive and define** what amount of savings, monthly income, or net worth is needed for you to feel *safe*. Whatever the amount, make sure you plan for it and have a large enough buffer to account for life's unknowns, like losing a job/client, getting hurt, meeting someone, family emergency and so on.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

**Employment and Career**

Arguably the hardest part in cracking the code, with not only becoming a DN but remaining one, is employment/income.

For work, one of us as an independent IT consultant and the other is a program manager and corporate training consultant. Pre COVID-19 the program manager amongst us had to regularly travel for work (10K+ flight miles a month was common), post COVID-19 the smart companies/clients pivoted, and we now (**thankfully**) find ourselves employed and busier than ever.

While you can leave with a few thousand bucks in your pocket and figure it out after the fact (hopefully!) we **highly recommend** that you figure out the money/income thing before you depart.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

**Backpack and Gear**

Everything we carry has a purpose and when possible. things perform double (or more) duty. We travel light and out of only carry-on bags (Osprey Manta AG 36L, r/onebag) because it makes us more nimble, saves on baggage fees, and eliminates the possibility of an airline losing our bags.

In 2016 we started off with our backpacks full and weighing in over 20lbs each but now we have room to spare and are at about 15lbs. Over time we’ve learned, adapted, and *perfected* our gear. We learned that what we *thought* we needed to make us happy was quite different than what we *actually* needed to make us happy.

We went back and forth on buying expensive or specialized gear before setting off. In the end, we passed on one hundred+ dollar tech pants or fifty+ dollar merino shirts, and **mostly** used what we already owned and filled in the rest with whatever gave us the best bang for our buck, i.e. $15-20 dollar Union Bay Tech Pants (from Costco).

We're not being critical of DNs who choose to buy new or specialized gear, we're simply saying that you don't *have* *to,* to be successful.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

**COVID-19 and Lifestyle Impact**

We consider ourselves **extremely fortunate** during these crazy times. We both have plenty of work, we’ve been able to keep a full-time schedule of house sitting jobs (so far), our loved ones are in good health, and so are we. Our current house sit in Carlsbad is coming to an end (after nearly eight weeks), but we have a two week sit scheduled immediately after in the Hillcrest neighborhood of San Diego.

Thankfully we’ve made some lifelong friends throughout the world and time and time again get to see firsthand the immense kindness people can have for strangers. When house sitting, we’re routinely invited/allowed to arrive early or leave late to make our full-time house sitting schedule work nearly without interruption.

Over the last two years we’ve averaged **$25 a month on lodging** costs (again this isn't realistic for most people). If house sitting isn't your style, don't ignore travel hacking r/travelhacking and credit card churning r/churning. We've enjoyed our fair share of *free* nice hotels, thanks to these strategies.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

**Friends and Socializing**

We’re grateful that we can travel together and not feel alone, especially in a COVID-19 world. Don’t get us wrong, travelling with your partner isn’t perfect, and in fact, comes with its own set of challenges. However in our humble opinions, it sure beats having to start over with meeting people from scratch every time you move to a new location. If we weren't a couple, it would mean a lot more time in social places and finding meetups and local DN communities e.g. bars, Facebook groups, local-led walking tours, etc.

If you’re an aspiring or new DN we can’t stress enough how important it is to be mindful of self-care! Meditate, exercise, prioritize sleep, eat well, sprinkle-in down-time, and open yourself up to serendipitous adventures. Be honest with yourself and if needed schedule it on your calendar, create a reminder, use a browser extension, get a smart band. The point is, **create a regiment and follow it!**

More than likely if you forego selfcare long-term, once the DN honeymoon phase wears off you’ll either feel really stressed and anxious about constantly being on the move, or you’ll get really depressed about being alone. Either outcome is likely to have you call it quits!

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

**Reality vs Fiction**

There’s no class (DN 101 anyone?!), e-book, or course that’s going to ensure you’re successful at becoming or staying a DN. Sure, you may find information that’s helpful amongst the abundance of resources, but in the end, it’ll mostly come down to you and your specific strengths, priorities, goals, and so on. 

If you’re an aspiring DN, we highly recommend taking the time to go through this sub's [**DN FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/b1hjq8/digital_nomad_newbie_survival_kit_faq_for) (anyone know why it’s no longer pinned!?) and leverage the experience and knowledge from seasoned DNs.

Also, it’s important to realize that while pictures of ‘laptops on beaches, or laptops with pretty vistas in the background’ may by motivational, there’s a big difference between someone who’s **really** making a living, saving, investing, and **thriving** while being a DN vs someone who bought a ticket to *enter your city of choice*, is scraping by, and **trying** to be a DN.

Remember, you'll likely be better off if you run towards something instead of away from it, and just because you’re in foreign countries, leveraging geo-arbitrage, and the envy of your friends, your deliverables and responsibilities, don't **magically disappear**… life will continue to go on and problems will still come up.

Thank you again for reading, we hope our intent comes across (forgive us if we sound preachy or like we're passing judgment), we were simply trying to point out these often-overlooked aspects to aspiring DNs. :-)

Safe travels!"

n9p6i6,12nwwb,"athens, greece and islands wifi strategy?","I'll be flying from USA into Greece on Sunday.  I'll have my Google Fi phone with me.  I think Google Fi is generally advertised as connecting to 1 of 3 networks - whichever one is best - at a given time and place.  But there are no guarantees with Google Fi.  For example, in my experience, the service was essentially useless in Reno, NV.  But when traveling abroad, Google Fi can be good default to have with you.  It will generally give you at least something until you can find something better.

I think a lot of travelers recommend buying a local SIM card.  I have an unlocked OnePlus 5T purchased in USA.  So when my plane touches down in Athens, what are my best bets to pick up a SIM card?  Is there a recommended shop in the airport for this?   Should I buy a SIM card from more than one provider?   What do the data packages/plans normally look like for this (cost,  speed, data caps, etc)?  I'll need a lot of data b/c I need a reliable data connection for work so I'll need 2 levels of failover."

To me the biggest gray area is that the purpose of travel for us is usually not directly work related.  But on the other hand we are doing buisness activity inside the accommodation that we rented.

What do you all think?"

I am someone with a mathematics degree doing a 1 year conversion course in Software Dev. I enjoy it and I have good analytical skills, especially in algorithmic thinking. 

I want to be employable in remote setting for the rest  of my career. (I am aware the advantages and pitfalls and stress I will have doing this... )Currently my course is giving a \*wide\* range of topics, and the thought is to find work experience in an area you want to branch of into. I want to get ideas, from software developers and engineers who are nomads, is there an area of expertise where short term, remote, well paid contracts are the norm? Anything where mathematics would be ann advantage? (I didnt choose a data analytics path, as I thought it would be unlikely companies would transfer data to a remote, contract worker, but i could be wrong...)

 I am also aware it will not be easy, and hope to work in a settled area first before becoming independent..

because  of it's size, it's primarily something for those traveling with a van.yeah sure, 99 bucks a month is a lot, but for the freedom provided - it can be worth it.One open question is, what areas will be support when  (legal question ? radio frequencies ?) and what area (technical question of satellite coverage).

I am having trouble getting in contact with the embassy and have contacted the Boston, NYC, and Washington DC embassies multiple times and no responses (covid I guess?). I work a fully remote job for a company based in the US and I am unsure if I should apply for a working visa, non-lucrative visa, or self-employment visa. I obviously don't work for a Spanish company so I wouldn't have letters saying I have a job there, but my work doesn't really qualify for self-employment since it is just a remote job. I don't think Spain takes telework into account so I am unsure of where to go. The other option would be the non-lucrative visa and I have seen some people on here talk about getting it even if they had a remote job since what they did on their computer is ""their business"". I have enough in my savings to meet the monetary requirement but I don't want to be evading Spanish taxes, so I guess I'm wondering how strict they are on the topic/if people can really get away with it.

I've been working remote for about 3 years now and have moved around within the US a bit. I'm currently learning Spanish and looking at living a few months here and there in South America once things open up. I've been to Argentina for work several times and love it.

My general question is how do you handle income taxes (in the US and abroad)? I know within the US when you are looking at working for a company in another state you apply the source rule, so for example right now I live in AZ and work for a company in CA, but do all of the work in AZ so I only pay AZ income tax. So, if I go live in Argentina for 3 months for example, can I avoid paying AZ and federal taxes for that time? And will I have to file in Argentina for those 3 months? How does it generally work?

nbod83,3eraftg9,Why remote companies should hire globally (Podcast),"Link => [podcast](https://buildingremotely.com/episode/why-remote-companies-should-hire-globally)

Short overview below.

Remote work should be a reality for everyone, no matter what country they live in.

Western countries primarily experience a deficit of knowledge workers. Fortunately, it is estimated that emerging economies will see 1.5 billion knowledge workers entering the workforce. Hiring a distributed team has traditionally been complex. **Tony Jamous** was set on fixing this problem by helping facilitate the connection of talent and opportunities on a global scale.

Enter **Oyster** \- a distributed talent enablement platform. He makes a strong case on why you should hire a globally distributed team, and how you can find hidden talent around the world. With him, we discussed:

* How hiring globally will enable remote companies to win through diversity and inclusivity
* Challenges companies face when hiring globally
* The most prominent work corridors Oyster enables
* How Oyster is training talent in non-western countries to reach remote companies in the western world and vice-versa
* Aspects that make and break a successful distributed organization
* How to overcome cultural differences through company culture."

I'd save a considerable amount of money by moving to a state with no income tax, I've done the math. However I'd like to visit NJ whenever possible.

If I move to a state like New Hampshire, Washington, or Florida, what's the minimum time I need to stay in that one state, to be considered a full-year resident of that state (so all my state taxes will be for that state)? Say I want to maximize my time in NJ, where income tax isn't as favorable.

Thankfully Covid skyrocketed the remote working revolution and many companies are allowing many positions to be done remotely, instead of mainly IT positions like before.

I will start working for a US-based company soon and I will maintain a US address and continue to pay my taxes there, but I don't plan to stay in the US. I will most likely travel and change places every few months. It seems some companies are cool with this and others are not. I don't know how it will be for me and I don't want to ask for now (it could be an option later on when I have proven myself and have some tenure).

**So how do you live the digital nomad/remote life without your employer finding out?**

**How do you hide your location if you are using a work computer and what about if you use your own?**

ndk55l,12nwwb,limitations with LHR Heathrow wifi,"I connected to Wifi @ Heathrow airport but I noticed a few things:

The WiFi icon on my phone while connected to LHR WiFi shows a status of ""Very Fast"" underneath.  However, looks like the WiFi configuration somehow prevents the execution of speed tests so not able to identify the specific WiFi speed available @ LHR.

Looks like the LHR WiFi prevents the download of apps to smartphone.  I wanted to download the ""Private Internet Access"" VPN app but looks like the WiFi configuration prevented this.  I'm assuming that general phone system update downloads are prevented as well so that would need to be done before flight or after arriving to hotel.

Looks like LHR WiFi blocks streaming.  For example, I opened the YouTube app on my phone and tried to play a video but the Loading spinner kept spinning and the video never played.  I'm sure that seasoned DN's are already aware of these LHR WiFi limitations but hopefully these tips will be be helpful to DN's with less extensive international travel experience like myself so just wanted to share this ""know before you go"" info"

Optionally: I have a UK mobile number on my main SIM card, it would be nice if this app could also give me the option to spoof my UK number for outgoing calls so that people in the UK know that it's me who's calling.

All the apps that I've looked at that do this sort of thing (Hushed, Line2, Cloudsim, etc) are way more expensive than they need to be.

I use to rent a US voip number from DidLogic for $1 a month, and most calls cost less than 1 cent a minute through them, but they started charging a minimum of $25 a month, and they didn't have SMS or voicemail, or an app.

Specifically, I'll be in Paris, London, and Amsterdam for a month a piece and plan to/have been asking AirBnB hosts to provide me with internet speeds, though I know that there are other factors (are they telling the truth, is the service actually consistent/reliable). So what do you guys do if you get somewhere and the internet just flat out sucks/drops for a time here and there? 

I have read that personal hotspots with pre paid plans, or that allow you to plug in a local SIM card are popular, however, my only question there was what do you do if the cellular connection in your place stinks? I also trust what I have read, but my experience with using my iPhone as a personal hotspot haven't been great even with good connection.

Sorry if this is general I would just like to hear what you experienced vets have to say, as this is my biggest concern as internet is obviously what will enable me to work remote as a software developer. 

Some additional info if it matters:

* I will be working in the same unit with my girlfriend who also needs good internet
* I can't work at WeWork type spaces for the sake of my company's security policies
* My work is mostly via remote desktop into a machine based in Chicago, but I will need to use Teams for video calls frequently
* My girlfriend isn't remoting into a machine, but she will similarly need to be available on calls, etc
* We both have PCs (I have a Razer Blade 15 on Win10 and my gf has a Dell running Ubuntu)
* I assume we will need near 30mbps+ download/upload of consistent connection, but let me know if that's not enough"

**English**: a large part of the people speak in English .. let's say like Dubai .. it is not the official language but almost everyone speaks it.

**Cheap**: Let's say you can rent a decent apartment for no more than $ 500-700 per month.

**Warm weather:** mostly sunny and quite warm weather (25-35 celsius degrees) .. close to the beaches.

&#x200B;

To better understand the situation, so far I have been to Dubai, Thailand (Bangkok and Phuket), and Miami in the winter months.

Let's say the perfect place for me would be Dubai, but for all those months it would get a little over budget ..

Miami, on the other hand, is not worth the money they ask for the rent .. more than $ 2000 a month for about 50sqm in downtown, where however it is full of homeless people and the degradation is gradually increasing in last years.

I've heard that Bali is cheap, but in winter there should be too much rain i think ( tell me if i'm wrong).

Key points:

- 12 month visa
- 1100€/month minimum income requirement
- must be employed by or owner of foreign company 
- must have health insurance 
- proof of no criminal record required 

This visa is of interest as it enables digital nomads to establish a home base in an EU country that is both a non-Schengen country and has a low tax burden. The (AFAIK) lowest income requirement is the icing on the cake.

Noob here -- I am, unfortunately, *not* a digital nomad. Though I vaguely aspire to one day become one!

Early 30s, remote career (since long before the pandemic made it normal!), plus just took a new job with a promotion and a big pay bump. However, with two little kids (age 5 and 2) being a *full-time* nomad is not in the cards for me.

There are plenty of old posts here about being a nomad with kids, however, not much about being a *part-time* nomad with kids -- spouse and I think living in one place the bulk of your time is healthier for the kids, as they advance from 'small kid' stage to 'older kid' stage -- schools, friends, etc.

However, I'm interested in finding way to incorporate ""nomadism"" into a lifestyle with kids around this age -- say from 5-6 to 10-12 years old. Anyone have experience with this? 

1. Tips on part-time nomad-ing? Is this even realistic or feasible? What could that look like?

So, this summer I plan to be living out of my car -- While it is a camper van, it's also got a low roof (not standing height), no running water/kitchen, etc.  Basically she's a great weekend warrior; not a great daily live/work space for the digital nomad. The benefit, though, is: I can hang up all my clothes, put art supplies and camping gear and towels and food into drawers and cabinets, and have a retreat/adventure vehicle ready whenever I need it.

I plan to live/work in several different places (plus take some trips) without overstaying my welcome; with various family, a significant other, and a couple housesitting gigs. With the van, I can go wherever, whenever, without having to worry about packing bags.

My work requires at least one monitor in addition to my laptop. It's a software gig, and I would just get frustrated working exclusively on a laptop everyday.

I have them in my order of preference. I am also considering **Oaxaca City, Mexico City and Guadalajara** incase remote beaches have excessive power outages or limited internet connectivity during this time.

Any tips would be really appreciated <3

I typically do not need a transit visa for Schengen layovers. I am unvaccinated though (my government did not get to my age group) and worried I would not be able to pass through Frankfurt.

nit47v,22wq0,The Monitor Problem,"As a professional writer, I can type into an iPad or laptop in a pinch, but can't do my best work until I'm back at home with ≥27"" monitor. It's the #1 obstacle to adopting a  nomadic lifestyle.

I did find [this very thin 24"" monitor](https://www.amazon.com/Sceptre-E248W-1920R-Ultra-1080p-Monitor/dp/B01HIA63AU) that weighs only 5lbs and detaches from its stand. But it's still a lot to carry around, and baggage handlers would kill it even in original box.

Guess I could ship monitor ($$$) to wherever I am, or buy a used one whenever I'm somewhere for more than a week or two (selling would be tough). How do others manage?

Note: If you're perfectly happy with laptop or iPad screen, good for you. I'm different. This is a thread about people who are different from you (TiaTAPWADFY)! :)"
nizkfg,3vr9fit3,Giving up my USA work visa for a remote job,"Hi, Im a 24 Mexican software developer, last year i got the oportunity to work in Texas under a temporal visa, been here for 1 year and a half.

I just got an offer to work remotely paid in USD (pretty good money), but im afraid of giving up the oportunity of MAYBE getting the US permanent recidency in a few years...

&#x200B;

Its a really corporate-like job which i fkng hate and to be honest I dont like the american culture too much... but is the land of oportunities after all (at least more than in Mexico) I would love to be a digital nomad but the fear of ""missing out"" this oportunity is keeping me here.

nj1z74,nqfv1,Satellite Internet Question,"My employer claims that the network in Thailand is not secure and therefore I cannot connect from my work laptop while here, even with VPN, because the traffic originates in Thailand.

nj6x5o,12nwwb,Is a PMB (Private Mailbox) really necessary as opposed to PO Box rental?,"I've been using TravelingMailbox for about a year now and I've found it to be a hassle.  I've been renting a PO Box at UPS Store as a central place to receive packages.  The UPS Store told me that they would forward my mail to me for a fee.  It would honestly be easier for me if I just get The UPS Store to forward all of my mail to me once/month as opposed to going through the motions of using the TM app to get my mail.

So is there any practical advantage to having a ""PMB""?  Based on my understanding, a PMB represents a physical address.  I think I read some posts from some people who said that this was helpful where a physical address was required in some scenarios?  But I'm curious if anyone here has encountered any scenarios where a PO Box rental at the UPS Store was not accepted by some other party as a primary address.  Honestly, I'm not exactly sure what the big difference is.  The address line 2 of my Traveling Mailbox address is:

Suite 202 PMB 94555

Whereas the address line 2 of my UPS Store address is:

Suite 102-555

Are there any practical downsides to having the latter form of the address compared to the former from any particular perspective?"

njfr14,4vfqg,USA citizen going DN to Europe..in August?,"Hello r/digitalnomad!

Long time lurker, infrequent poster here. I've finally built up my business to the point where I'll be quitting my day job and taking the business full time. With that being said, I've got the opportunity towards the beginning to begin the journey in August and I'm looking towards Eastern Europe.

With the recent news of opening coming this past week, does August still feel too early to book the trip now in May?

Cities/Countries I'm planning to stay in are:

1. Bucharest, Romania,
2. Sofia, Bulgaria
3. Budapest, Hungary
4. Belgrade, Serbia

I understand each country has their own specific restrictions into letting US citizens in at the current moment, but August feels like it should have the green light by then.

njgqxm,12nwwb,taxis in international cities - ask if they take credit card first?,"I'm in Athens for the first time.  I flew in last Sunday.  I think so far pretty much every single vendor has accepted credit card.  The only vendor who didn't take credit card was my cab driver who drove me from the airport to the hotel.

When he pulled up to my hotel, I wasn't clear if he was telling me that ""his credit card machine wasn't working"" or if he didn't take credit card at all.  He was driving a yellow Mercedes cab so it seems like taking credit card would be pretty standard for $40+ cab rides.  All I had was USD so I ended up giving him about a $20 tip because he wasn't going to accept USD at first.

Is this a common scam when Athens cab drivers pick up unsuspecting tourists from the airport?  As a matter of practice,  should I explicitly ask the cab driver if he takes credit card and if his credit card machine is working before getting into the cab?  I think I may have had the same thing happen to me in Paris a few years ago but several people had told me to avoid Paris cab drivers because there is a high likelihood of getting scammed.  In my Paris scenario I was late for a flight so the taxi was my only option."

njnknz,6dwne86j,Airbnbs with *stable* internet in Mexico? Looking for specific recommendations.,"I’ve spent hours and hours on Airbnb scanning hundreds of reviews of Airbnbs in Mexico, looking for where the guest talks about the WiFi. And honestly? No one ever mentions it. They. Just. Don’t. 

I teach English online so stability, low latency, decent upload speeds, (and/or access to the modem for an Ethernet connection), matters more to me than download speed. So if you teach English online, or if you just do a lot of video calls with your camera on and screen sharing the whole time, please send me any specific Airbnb recommendations you may have. 


As for locations, I’ll be wandering all over Mexico  for the next year or so, but mostly in the cities with good infrastructure.

I've lived in Spain before on a student visa a several years ago, but I haven't been back since. 

&#x200B;

I have some questions that looking around I have not found super clear answers on, so I came here to ask some questions about how all this works.

&#x200B;

1. I've done some research into digital nomad visas/permits (Like the one that is currently offered in Croatia), but how would this work if they did not have a visa specifically for digital nomads? Do I need to apply for a work visa in places like Belgium, Germany, or the Netherlands? Or can I stay on my passport as long as I don't exceed the 90 days?
2. With the previous question in mind, what are some good places in Europe to be in the months of August-November? 
3. Do you have any suggestions for good resources on finding co-working spaces? I don't mind working from my Airbnb but if I have a chance I'd like to find a good space where I can work around other like-minded people.

njzet6,bk3cx6gu,Does anybody use the TV in an AirBnB as a viable second monitor?,"There is always the monitor question especially for those that are used to a combination of multiples or, in my case, a gorgeous ultrawide.  It seems like the general consensus based in other posts, in order of precedence:

1. Learn to be productive off of your 14"" laptop monitor
2. Portable second monitor
3. Buy a local monitor when you arrive
4. Carry larger monitors in checked-in bags.

Is there anyone that rigs up a workstation using the TV that is present in your AirBnB or other rented room? Especially if you are going to be there for a few weeks, just considering whether it might work to rearrange a bit and use the TV screen, especially in combination with wireless keyboard/mouse/trackpad.  Low fidelity as it is compared to a computer monitor, the screen real-estate can come in handy, especially as a software dev or even if you are prone to staring at particularly populated spreadsheets."

nlnh9g,,Staying productive (coding) while traveling?,"I got the approval from my manager to remain remote for the rest of 2021, and I feel like it's finally time I took advantage of it.  Besides 2-3 zoom meetings a week, I spend 95% of my work time doing software development...which I've mostly done from my apartment since the beginning of the pandemic.  I did take advantage of being able to travel since I've gotten the vaccine and have spent 2-3 weeks with family, but I find my productivity dramatically decreases even if I find a quiet place, because all I've got is my mouse and my big external monitor and standing desk are gone (not to mention my very nice ergonomic chair), all paid for by my work.

I plan on joining some friends in Honolulu for for about a month, and then after that potentially hopping around Airbnbs maybe in San Diego, LA, visiting family in Florida, etc. basically spending 1-2 months at a time max in any given place.

One thing is paying taxes, but there's more that could be done... 

I tried linking to the video but it was removed, so i guess i'll try to add it in a comment below, but the gist of the video was how places like Paris are so amazing (ok well maybe not right now but at one point at least it was) because people went in and ""invested"" in building beautiful buildings and architecture that wasn't ""necessary"" but it has been appreciated for generations afterwards. 

I've spent years living in different countries, but other than giving my money to the local supermarkets and sometimes maids or other small tasks, i can't say that i've really invested or added value to where i've lived.

I have had ideas though..like how much would it really cost to hire someone to put nice siding or plaster on unfinished concrete homes in South America.

nmb9co,4hufu9f3,Your guide to the Digital Nomad's VPN setup,"Having lost my first remote job due to an improper VPN setup, I want to share the lessons I learned and hopefully this gets pinned so that anyone else getting started in the digital nomad's lifestyle does not have to go through what I did and lose a job.

I do now have a better-paying remote job that I have been able to keep due to this setup.

First thing first, no free and/or shared VPN's

**Step 1** \-

Get yourself a VPN router, [I currently have this nice colorful, mini, portable router that is a total beast for $26](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-mt300n-v2/), [if you need 5G support go with this bad boy costing $70](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-ar750s/), on the go the router can connect to any WiFi connection whether in a hotel, cafeteria or AirBnB, you then can connect from the router to your PC via Ethernet or WiFi, the router can also connect through Ethernet and be connected from Ethernet at the same time!

**Step 2** \-

Get a ~~Dedicated~~ Residential VPN, the VPN service provider that you choose depends on your job location. I use ~~RapidVPN~~ ~~while it is an underdog it does have way more locations for its Dedicated IP than the likes of NordVPN or CyberGhost~~ [StarVPN](https://www.starvpn.com/) great locations at an affordable price providing excellent customer service and router support. Make sure that your VPN supports OpenVPN or WireGuard as this is the default set up for the MT300N-V2 from GL.Inet.

with these two steps your good to go, travel anywhere you like in the world and appear as if your are at your designated workplace location without any worries. Even if you are at a fixed location setting your VPN up through your router can prevent your ISP from leaking especially if you are using company equipment in which they can log your IP on startup.

Pro Tip: If you do not have a residential address in location in which your job is located you can always get a virtual mailbox from the likes of [PostScanMail.com](https://PostScanMail.com) or others depending on the state in which you are needing one from.

Good luck and enjoy your travels!"
nmf83a,9yjlnco9,"I'm moving to Sevilla, anyone/everyone is WELCOME!","I see a lot of different nomad hot spots being thrown around and honestly most don't call to me, i'm sure they are great places though.

I've been a lot of different places except for Asia, so  I can't speak to that but pound for pound honestly the lifestyle in Europe is so better than anything in South America, Mexico  or the Caribbean. 

Here's my Sevilla pitch having lived there for 8 months prior to covid and why i'm returning end of June.

Background , 28 yrs old , work remotely in tech, 

&#x200B;

1. Safety- (i'm looking at you female digital nomads) , Sevilla is one of the safest cities in the world, far safer than any American city. I feel comfortable walking around the city at any hour , even the other american girls in my group of friends remarked at how safe they felt. Having lived in Dominican republic , I kind of dont want to worry about safety , i like to leave my apartment with my watch, phones, laptops etc.. and not worry. In sevilla safety wont even cross your mind lol that's how you know its safe. With that being said its still a city so don't be a idiot lol
2. City Size, its a BIG city, not a mega city tho but still a big city. Mega cities I would say are capitals like madrid, paris, nyc etc..  Sevilla is a tier down which makes it so much more chill. You don't have the hordes of tourist or any of the other problems. 
3. Walkability - Sevilla is extremely walkable for a large city, and you have good bus systems and my personal favorite a amazing network of private bike lines throughout the city. This city is a bikers dream. For 20 bucks a month you get city bike pass and use any of the city bikes unlimited. You do not need a car at all to live here. I loved that aspect of it.
4. Culture- Sevilla represents quintessential spanish culture. ie flamenco, tapas, Castellano, the feria festival , etc...
5. Architecture- I've heard spanish people describe the city as a fairy tale, and its so true, the city is visually stunning
6. Parque maria lousia - This is sevilla's version of ""central park"" and its gorgeous, I probably went their almost every weekend lol, and did tons of picnics with my friends  .
7. COST of living- Sevilla is VERY cheap, obviously not as cheap as Latin America but honestly I think paying extra for the safety, culture, convenience, lifestyle is worth it. I'm getting a baller apartment with a private terrace in the heart of the city but theirs options for everyone that are all in the city and walkable. Drinking and food are also cheap
   1. [https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Sevilla](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Sevilla)
8. Food Quality- This is a HUGE one for anyone whos living in mexico,DR, etc.. The water and food is CLEAN, no worries there. Eat until your heart is content in sevilla. 
9. Food- The food is pretty damn good. Although its not the level of good like NYC where you could walk onto any block and find the fuego food, in sevilla you need to know the spots but they are there so its just a question of finding them.
10. Fashion- yeaaaaa this one in important , the Sevillanos are known for dressing up. Don't come here with shorts and flip flops as a dude. Except for the few hot summer months I rarely walk around the city without a button down , blazer or something stylish. Originally I came to the city with your typical american style clothes like polos shirts and khakies etc.. I ditched them pretty quick and just bought whatever was in fashion at H&M & Zara, not gonna lie I was looking pretty dapper rolling down the street in dark sun glasses, airpods, italian leather shoes, blue blazer and some matching jeans. Since guys in Sevilla dress fashionable your going to need to dress fashionable if you want to meet girls. I can say switching my wardrobe changed my experience , it sounds stupid on the face but once I bought nice clothes how people treated me completely changed. For starters everyone would assume im from sevilla and not a tourist, and 2nd girls loved it.
11. Dating- Assuming you followed my above point on fashion, you will have no problem getting dates and meeting girls. This is probably the most fun city ever to have a romance in, I was dating a french girl that I met there and we had the best time at night bouncing around the city between different tapas spots and cafes. Its a very pro PDA city lol so you will see plenty of couples making out at night on the sidewalks, parks, and various little enclaves around the city. I think being such a safe city allows this to happen. Theirs just sooo many good romantic date spots in sevilla between the park, the river, the little cafes. speaking Spanish will definitely open more doors but you can definitely date with only English. 
12. Neighborhoods- Its a big city but each neighborhood is distinct and has has a real community feel. I went to the same cafes/food spots during the work week and got know everyone in my little area pretty good. A few times I walked into my favorite Italian spot for lunch with my girlfriend ,and the owner of the cafe would bring me two free lattes as we waited for food, I felt like a BOSS , of course my GF would be rolling her eyes at my beaming smile lol. Honestly if you say hi to everyone in your little area and make a point to get to know people even with limited Spanish people will notice it and like it, its flattering for sure.
13. Exercising/lifting - Theirs plenty of great gyms for super cheap all around the city. The newest one I plan on joining is called ""body pump"" its one of those fancy new age hipster gyms with yoga, classes, weights , etc... its cool, all the girls I know are going there. Theirs also a facility to play tennis on the far side of the city, theirs rowing, biking groups, alot mountain biking groups, cross fit, rock climbing, running, rowing, overall its a very active city
14. Religion - Sevilla is a catholic city 1000% (i'm catholic too,for full disclosure lol ) . Theirs nothing more beautiful then the Easter festival and parade, each church carries  massive effigies of jesus or some the patron saints down the street. These effigies/statues are so big it requires teams of 10-15 men to carry it. Walking around the city you will see tons of paintings or murals of jesus or saints, I would say nearly every apartment and street corner has atleast one jesus mural lol if not 2 or 3. The younger gen is less religious then the older but sunday is very much still a church day. 
15. Skiing- Sevilla does not have any mountains BUT skiing is very accessible because you can take a direct 2hr train ride to Granada, and the cost of skiing is very affordable. I paid around 40 bucks for a lift ticket and snagged a 1 bed 1 bath airbnb walking distance to the lift for 100 a night lol what a joke.. compared to anywhere in the US that's insanely cheap.
16. Beach- Theirs multiple beaches about 1 hr or so from sevilla that you can get to by bus
17. Language barrier- You need a basic level of Spanish if your going to live here. People in the pharmacy or grocery store are not going to speak ANY english. I would recommend going to one of the language schools to learn, its a great way to meet other people too. 
18.  Marijuana- its pretty much legal, you can't be puffing on a jay in public but theirs tons of dispensaries around the city
19. BEING IN EUROPE! This one point destroys all the other South American or Caribbean destinations because you can do SO much more on the weekends. We would take weekend trips to paris , venice, rome, madrid, all these amazing world class cities. Living in the dominican republic didn't afford me that same lifestyle. Its common to find Ryan Air roundtrip tickets between sevilla - other major cities for less than 50 dollars. So once covid passes we should see this go back to normal. 

&#x200B;

My final closing point is time/visa situation. Three months isn't enough time to integrate. Its not even enough time to establish true friendships. Fortunately I was able to snag an Italian citizenship through my Great Grandpa but prior to that I was trying to figure out a way to stay in spain since getting a visa is nearly impossible for work reasons. So the easiest path to getting a year or more visa is to take a class and get the student visa. For most people this actually makes a ton of sense because you can get a visa for studying spanish at the uni or smaller institutions, and that would kill two birds with 1 stone since you need Spanish in Sevilla so let that be the reason for the visa. Note tho, you need to apply for the student visa in the US and can't do it from spain. 

&#x200B;

Meeting friends- I wrote this post because I had very lonely covid year in the US. Some of my friends trickled back to Sevilla as the borders have opened up but its been tough year. Not having a robust friend group is hard, as digital nomads loneliness is something we all battle. So I decided i'm pitching my tent in sevilla and inviting anyone that wants to come . You're more than welcome to join my friend group, its a great city and if you have the courage to travel all this way i'm sure we'd get along !

&#x200B;

Take care everyone , cheers!

My budget is around 750 usd / month for accommodation, I could stretch that a little bit though. 

In a lot of the digital nomad spaces I'm seeing lots of stuff on how you can stay in Guanacaste province (which is my preference but I am not picky) for like usd 500 /month... but I'm finding absolutely nothing at all, even half a bunk bed in a hostel is going for 900/mo - it seems to get a small but good working/living space it's going to be more like 1600-2500 usd a month, which is waaaay off the ""you can get a whole villa for 500!""

Just wondering what's up - if I'm looking in the wrong spots (geographically, or also looking on the wrong apps), or do I just need to reign in my expectations, as in costa rica is just that expensive and I should look elsewhere? Is everything good and cheap already booked because CR is one of the first countries to open up?

It just seems strange that costa rica is hailed as this place for digital nomads by a ton of publications but when you get into it, it's very, very expensive.

np9vfq,8nant,Why you probably don't really want to be a digital nomad,"I think “Digital Nomadism” is one of those things like being a social media influencer: everyone *wants* to do it because it seems glamorous and exciting, very few are actually successful, and it’s a lot more “work” than people realize. I’ve been a full-time DN (kinda, but that’s for another post) for a few months now and I wanted to share with this sub why you don’t *actually* want to be a digital nomad.

1. **It’s really, really hard to find a good job.**

I made a post a while back about the [most common jobs in the top 300 posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/lzsodu/i_surveyed_the_top_300_posts_in_rdigitalnomad/) in this subreddit, and the majority were in technology or social media, or some combination thereof. These are not just jobs you *get*, they aren’t entry level and they require a lot of technical knowledge, skill, experience, and dedication. The narrative that some 20-year-old learns a little code and Good Will Huntings his way into a DN career that makes $100,000 USD a year so he can work an hour a week and spend the rest of time on hookers & blow in Tulum is not… accurate (usually).

The reality is, employers don’t want people to work remotely, and they ***definitely*** don’t want them working overseas. Even independent contractors are often geographically locked for tax and licensing reasons. I applied for a few remote positions within Alaska (where I’m from) that I would have been perfect for based on my experience and education. I actually got the jobs, but ended up having to turn them down because of their strict location requirements. Despite the jobs being 100% remote, they *still wanted me in the state.* It hurts their professional credibility with their clients for their employees to be in another state, much less another country.

And they aren’t just *wanting* their employees to be local, they’re demanding it. Most employers are using geotracking and other technology to ensure their data isn’t being accessed where it isn’t supposed to be. So I say all that to say, finding a job where you are so capable and amazing at it that employers are willing to pay you remotely and overlook massive tax and legal issues to let this happen is way, way less common than people want to realize. The majority of people who make *good* money at remote work have leveraged decades in the field and have demonstrated phenomenal skills to justify their usefulness to an employer in a remote capacity. Also, most DNs will be independent contractors which also means you’re not getting the benefits (healthcare, 401k) that your peers are getting, and there isn’t really a good way around this.

**2. It’s a logistical nightmare**

A laptop on the beach is a fun, sexy idea, but I can tell you from experience that very few jobs will allow you to work with the sketchy internet that a beach provides. Plus a lot of Airbnb’s and hotels are not providing the sort of internet that allows for even casual internet usage, much less heavy data professional download/upload speeds. There are certain places that tend to be catered to more digital nomad lifestyles, but those are getting increasingly expensive.

It is really difficult to remain professional when your internet keeps dropping because you’re on a yurt in the jungle. Or because a donkey is braying and guys are yelling in Arabic inches from your workspace. Or when you’re having to conduct a meeting at 2 a.m. in the pitch black because of time zone differences. You also have to factor in the logistics of healthcare, cell phone/internet service, mail forwarding, the increasing cost of tourism, traveling with the gear and equipment to maintain high professional standards, etc. A lot of remote jobs require fibre optic internet, landline phone connections, specific geographically locked software, and other security features that are shockingly difficult to navigate overseas or on the road.

**3. You don’t want to be a digital nomad, you just want a vacation**

I’ll be honest, I fell into this trap a little bit. I had the mentality that I could work for two or three hours a day, and spend the rest of my time exploring and hiking and Living My Best Life. But the reality is, digital nomadism isn’t sustainable without work. A lot of work. A lot of difficult, stressful work.

I met a really awesome lady in New York City who is doing the full-time digital nomad thing like I was, and she spent 10+ hours a day in her tiny Manhattan room. She got to go to a few of the sites a couple of times, but I saw her working very hard in uncomfortable working conditions to afford to spend her weekends doing the tourist thing. She was happy but after a few months of the lifestyle she was already burnt out on the constant moving, the expense, the unpredictability and the logistical frustrations and was looking to settle down again. And this was *in the United States. With a professionally remote position. That she had worked for years to obtain.*

I think we want the idea of an extended, permanent vacation but that’s not what digital nomading is. You’ll still be working 8, 10, 12 hours. Sometimes more. And you’ll likely make less money. Sometimes *a lot* less. The trade off can be very worth it, but it’s still a trade off.

**4. It can be pretty lonely**

Complete cultural immersion in another country is cool in theory, until you’re trying to make friends and you can’t even say more than “hi, how are you?” in their language. Expat communities are becoming more common, and a lot more interconnected through the Internet, however you tend to just meet people that you could’ve met at home, and what’s the point of that?

One of the underappreciated benefits of staying local instead of going remote is the concept of longevity and stability in relationships. Getting to see family and friends whenever you want is some thing you don’t quite recognize as being important until you don’t have it anymore. You can make friends on the road but it tends to be a Single Serving Size Friendship and those can get kind of bland and sad if your personality doesn’t lend to that kind of connection.

—

I say all that to say, it really isn’t for everybody. I’m not trying to discourage people from going for it, but definitely look into the reality and not just the picture perfect idea of what it is to be a nomad. I had a vague idea of some of these drawbacks initially and I’m going for it anyway (as many will) but I definitely didn’t realize exactly how many roadblocks and barriers there are to DN success right now. I’m interested to hear what y’all think about this."

nqprnh,c6i5tbhe,I(M18) kind of accidentally became a nomad and want to stick with this lifestyle,"Hi all. I am in a kind of weird but awesome situation. A year ago I did my A level exams in Germany (Covid was already a thing back then). I knew that my travel plans to New Zealand wouldn't work out in any way, so I decided to immediately go to University and pursue a higher degree in Economics/Computer science. 
I moved to a new city and hoped to somewhat enjoy my newfound freedom and of course ""student life"". Instead Germany went into second total lockdown and left me alone in my flat. On top of being alone the winter in Germany is very cold so hobbies like cycling and running that I had left didn't bring as much fun as usual. Also i broke up with my girlfriend. Hard times for me and probably the same as many other people. Video games 8h a day apparently was my brains  first solution to that.

Then in March things got better. All of my studies took place over the internet so I had the idea to just leave Germany and live on Canary islands while studying remotely. I calculated it through and found that living abroad is actually less expensive. Thanks to the encouragement from my family I followed through with this plan and boi is it awesome here in Tenerife. Probably the best decision in my life so far. I quit video games, eat healthy again and slowly slip back into a good sleep habit. But now I don't want to go back, not yet, perhaps never,  I just can't. Life has to be more than this misery (Even if it gets back to normal in the next year probably) This made me now quit University. I do have some volunteering work opportunities on Canary Islands to support myself in terms of food and a place to sleep. This is like a normal gap year and it gives me time to readjust, learn about another culture and learn Spanish. 

After this year I of course still can return to Germany for a degree...if there is no other way.

That's the point where Digital nomad lifestyle comes into play and the reason why I'm writing this post. I know that I will have to work hard and start now, if I want any of this to happen and also make a decent living. Not having a degree makes it probably even harder, if not impossible. The idea of working on the internet and/or creating (online)-business always appealed to me but, apart from a unsuccessful RedBubble Page I created with my sister, I never tried anything because I felt no need for it and had enough other work opportunities.

This now leaves me with some questions I hope to find an answer in this community.

First: What could be a good job/side hustle to start NOW and earn NOW? I want this to bring in some income just for a personal safety cushion (one that's not my parents) and perhaps for reinvesting into my first more sustainable and more passive income stream or just to replace some clothes, get ice cream eg. My skillset consists of advanced computer skills, probably somewhat good writing/reading/speaking in English and German(was at least pretty good back in school) and I have good logical/analytical understanding wich helps to pick up new skills. Especially good if the job is somewhat scalable by acquiring better skills and reputation as building any business or influence will take some time.

Second: How do I deal with my very young age? Do people care? What could help to at least get a trial to prove my skills to them and to myself?

Third: Are there places to get good resources for learning all kinds of things? I expect a lot of of trial and error ahead so it would be nice to have something or someone to turn to for fresh impulses and general knowledge.

And last but not least: From what I've shared with you, are my expectations somewhat realistic? Is there something I seem totally unaware of? What would you do in my situation?


To whoever reads this: This was a long post, thank you so much for reading my story and perhaps answering one of my questions. You have my total admiration if your living this life!"

2. Dedicated business-class 100 Mbps down/20 Mbps up internet (no rate limits)

When I say ""dedicated,"" what I mean is that this guesthouse would have its own internet subscription and infrastructure separate from the main house. So you would get the full gigabit or 100 Mbps connection all to yourself, your own modem, your own router, etc.

**Which would you prefer between these two options?** Does it matter to you? Both would be more than good enough for Zoom, streaming, etc.

Btw, this guesthouse will be in an urban area in the US with great 4G/LTE coverage in case you need to set up your own hotspot in a pinch.

My biggest worry when I was actively nomading was internet reliability more than the top-line speed. I'm a software engineer who 1. is very tech savvy and knows that the actual speed almost never reaches the top-line number, and 2. is mostly using wifi for streaming videos, uploading code, etc. My needs aren't hardcore, but I was absolutely dependent on constant stable connection for my job. I appreciate business-class because it's reliable and support technicians are quicker to fix your problem, which means that my host will be able to fix the problem quicker.

However, I don't know how other people would feel. My heart says ""go with business-class, it's what you would want and it's good enough for 99% of people,"" but my marketer gut says ""go with gigabit, people will feel better when they see the big number.""

Thoughts?"
nqy8w5,,Remote work Trend," How does the future look like for remote jobs in CS?

Most companies I know are adopting remote change, however it is all partial, and not fully remote. That is, 3 days remote, 2 days at the office.

Do you think in the next few years many new fully remote jobs will appear?

Could that be problematic, for example, they could lower the salary, since people from poor countries could do it as well, for less pay. Could it happen that Digital nomads would increase by a lot, and all flood Thailand or Mexico?"

nrjfqx,,Best & Worst Locations to Be a Female Digital Nomad?,"There are several factors that make a place desirable or undesirable for women to stay in- culture, traditions, acceptable behavior in public (ie. extreme cat-calling or harrassment), general safety (sometimes women tend to be more common targets of theft, for example), religion, societal norms- so let's discuss which cities/countries each of us (male or female, all are welcome to discuss their personal experiences) have found to be the best and worst places to be a female DN. 

As DNs, we stay in certain cities/countries for much longer than the average traveller. This should be taken into account as some places, for example, I can handle being treated differently because I'm a woman for a week, but you could not pay me enough to tolerate that attitude for several months. 

With all this in mind, tell me about your own experiences and the places you would or would not recommend for women based on these experiences!

ns11rg,boj0h0tn,Getting a mortgage for buying real estate as digital nomad?,"hi everyone,

My question belongs thematically in two camps but maybe someone here played around with the thought as well.

As a digital nomad/freelancer I somehow have to take care of my retirement by myself. I don't contribute to any state pension since a couple of years now and I don't plan to do so again. For that reason, I'm building my own portfolio that hopefully will be enough in 30 years times.

Now, as a digital nomad you come around more than others and see different markets. I'm looking into a diversification of my portfolio by buying a rental property.

I have the option to buy cash, but from a financial point of view it makes more sense to get a mortgage, buy a property and let the tenants pay for the mortgage.

Now, what options do I have to get a mortgage?

To be honest, I never seriously tried because I don't have a regular job. Ofc, I have my own company and a regular income through it - but I don't have \*that\* typical security I think I would have to have (9to5, 40h/week). I mean, I'm in my home country now and wait for my 2nd vaccination to kick off in July again, but I'm actually not officially registered here. I'm living since 6 months under the radar ... so walking to a mortgage lender as a person who doesn't officially exists is probably a red flag. Additionally, I'm looking into buying a property that is not located in my home country - which would be another red flag.

So maybe coming back to the topic building wealth as a digital nomad - is the only option to buy assets with cash? (stocks, rental property etc)"

If you are a nomad you don't need a visa that is good for a year. Many countries offer visa-free access or at least easy to obtain tourist visas good for multiple months so why bother with all the paperwork and hassle?   
To me, ""digital nomad visas"" seem more like a way to immigrate to a country while having a location-independent job instead of being suitable for actual nomads. One of the best aspects of being a digital nomad is also the independence you get from not having to integrate yourself into the bureaucracy and taxation of the country you are visiting. WHY would you voluntarily subject yourself to this?"

I will add to that info that you can either bring covid test results (under 72 hours old) with you, or get the test at the airport for under $30. No real quarantine of any sort. Also, you can get vaccinated for free in Armenia - anyone, with any passport.

A little background.  So my family started a business in social media content creation while we were living in Thailand.  It turns out, we were really good at it.  Over the past 6 months, we invested in a townhouse that's an office/studio and built it out to make content specifically for Facebook, YouTube and TikTok, all in Thai language.  We've been slowly hiring and building a team to really run the business without us being hands on.  We had a Covid Scare with my wife that turned out to be Allergies. But for a week, she absolutely kept herself at home and had the team run everything.  They did a fantastic job and it hit my wife that we were truly free to live anywhere we wanted.  

So she decided that she wanted to move to America for a year and give the kids a chance to experience American culture.  This seems like exactly the opposite of what you're supposed to do as a nomad.  But for some reason, it sounded like a crazy adventure so I said yes.  We certainly can afford it.

nvsog0,12nwwb,laptop lockup strategy for hotels?,"When traveling the world it's not always practical or possible to find a hotel with a safe that will accommodate a laptop.  For example, I'm currently in Santorini at a hotel with a safe which will only accomodate some passports and cell phones.  But the following strategy occurred to me.  After checking into a hotel, I empty the contents of my 62 linear inch suitcase.  At this point I could put my laptop bag in the suitcase and loop a cable lock around the suitcase.  

This would hide the laptop from plain sight (temptation).  A thief is generally more likely to steal a relatively small, high value laptop case as opposed to a relatively large and heavy locked suitcase with unknown contents.  This strategy would also prevent someone from opening the suitcase enough to pull the laptop out.  I could also wrap an additional cable lock from the suitcase to a bedpost, chair, etc but I doubt that this would be necessary in the top 100 tourist friendly cities.

Has anyone else here taken a similar approach to secure their laptops in their hotel rooms when traveling abroad?"

I am 25 years old, single, no kids. So this is a perfect opportunity for me. I have started to get tired of my routines with the 8-5 work life. I'm not living my life, I'm just alive. 

So I have about 5 months to prepare for this. I don't know what I'm going to do, or where I'm going to go. But Ive got some planning to figure out. I have a bunch of stuff im going to need to get rid of to minimize. Planning on having about $20k-$30k in savings for this. 

I would totally love to hear some advice from people. Give me your tips and tricks how I can do this right. Please ask me questions or pm me! Especially for help finding remote or contracting work. 

Thank you so much ♥️"

I’m a 21yr old  freelance digital marketer (PPC) making $1k per month by freelancing for agencies. 

I currently have 3k in savings want to go full digital nomad. 

I want to know what would be the best advice for someone with low savings, and what would be the best location adapted to my budget , I was thinking Asia, Bali, Thailand. 

I speak Spanish so Latin America wouldn’t be bad either. 

I’m really looking for the best way to get started with my current income and savings.

All advice welcome 
Thanks in advance"
nxrofc,rgonfuk,"Cheap~ish, cool and vibrant places during the summer for vaccinate europeans?","I get that this might be a bit... ahm, off topic, but I think that it's best to ask this here given that you guys are used to nomading constraints (e.g. apartments with decent internet speed and workspaces)

Basically, I hate the summer heat. Don't get me wrong, I like heat, just not European summer heat, especially not what it's been in recent years.

My ideal weather is 16degrees at night - 26 degrees mid-day kinda weather.

As it stands my options to get this are:

\- Scandinavian countries (very very expensive, bit boring)

\- Mountain towns around the alps (kinda expensive, not very vibrant... not a lot of fellow travelers of my age, mainly retirees and wealthy families)

\- Canary islands or other atlantic islands (Honestly, after this autumn+winter, I'm burnt out on islands, plus most are somewhat expensive and suffer from a bit of the above demographic issue)

\- ??? Presumably anywhere in the southern hemipshere, but most countries there are closed off to tourists due to covid at the moment :/

&#x200B;

I get that most people here probably enjoy summers, but for the life of me I can't get how someone could ever wish to live in more than 28 degrees. So any suggestions would be welcome :)

nxy0kw,11r6fo,"Has anyone ever considered Mauritius as a remote working destination? If so, why or why not?","
Context - I'm in software development, working as a product manager for an EU-based startup, so I'm more of a digital nomad wannabe at this stage. If not for COVID I'd probably be in Portugal or SEA right now. I'm also Mauritian and currenlty living there, although I lived overseas for about 6 years total.

Obviously for me, it's not that interesting here since I grew up here and the beaches/nature stuff are a bit 'meh' at this point. However, I'm starting to wonder whether there are people who have considered Mauritius as some destination to work remotely, and ideally who have succeeded, or decided otherwise. In my very-biased experience, I could see why this could be interesting to digital nomads, but not quite sure why this hasn't really picked up.  


**Pros -** 

1. Broadband has a fairly good coverage overall 20MBPS is standard, mobile data as well is fairly cheap (I'm on $8 a month for unlimited, with a soft cap). Not super fast though.
2. English-speaking friendly. Everything is mostly written in English. Everyone speaks basic English.
3. Costs of living are okay - $8- $20 for a restaurant meal. Under $3 for street food.
4. Timezone is great, only 2 hours of EU during summer time, and 2 hours behind India. (Works great for me since I work with both without needing to have odd hours).
5. Nature is great - Beaches/mountains are quite nice. Air is fantastic (I've lived in Tier 2 cities in China - quite the difference). Weather is also great - largely between 15-30 degrees year round.

**Cons -** 

1. No cheap flights to get there, since it's in the middle of the indian ocean.
2. Purchase of services are not very digitalised - might be tricky to get around some things as information is either not well advertised online (this is getting better), but logistics can be the main issue.
3. Public transportation sucks. No online scheduling, taxis are expensive. If you don't own/rent a car, it's very hard to travel.

Those are some of the things I can think of at the top of my head. I'm also thinking of a post-covid situation, where there's no need for quarantining and stuff.   


So. Mauritius? Why or why not?"

nyb0uy,12nwwb,should I avoid spirits/liquor entirely in greece?,"Supposedly it's a big issue for local businesses to mix methanol with their spirits.  I read an article from 15 years ago online and the government found that 100% of tequila and rum tested in Athens was laced at least to some degree with methanol.  And 50% of vodka was laced with methanol.  If you Google it you will find that it's a risk in Greece.  Sealed drinks like beer are safe though.

Seems like a lot of Greek businesses are unscrupulous when it comes to serving dangerous concoctions to unsuspecting tourists.  Which I found surprising since I've met so many very friendly and hospitable people in Greece.   

What got me thinking was that I went to a local restaurant today (a bit up the street and without a water view) in downtown Thira/Fira (Santorini) and I asked for a vodka martini.  I got a drink that was slightly more viscous, somewhat sweeter and with a slightly dingy yellow color.  It didn't taste dirty (olive salt water) or like an olive marinade in general (had 3 olives in it).  The guy told me it was ""absolute vodka."" I knew that wasn't true because I've had many absolute vodka martinis and shots in the past.

At first I rationalized that it was the olives but after a minute I came to the conclusion that it wasn't vodka.  And he gave it to me in a tumbler glass with what appeared to be 1 shot or less so I asked him to make it a double and put it in a martini glass.  Which also made me wonder if vodka martinis are not much of a thing here because it seemed so alien to him.  His English and communication were 8-9/10 otherwise.

Wikipedia says that methanol is sweet:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol

I wonder if that's the sweetness I was tasting?  Or if he was using some other type of moonshine or home brew alcohol.  Overall he was very hospitable but the vodka experience left me wondering."

nytfeb,5yrmw04g,Navigating schengen visas as a US citizen,"Hi friends, I have a question about schengen visas.

Currently, I am on the remote worker visa in Iceland. 

(https://work.iceland.is/working/icelands-remote-work-long-term-visa/)

I have been here for 3 months, and i have another 3 months left on my visa.  I just got my vaccine shot here (J&J so I only need one shot) and I am not particularly happy in Iceland (it’s a great country, but it’s too similar to home for me).

I am confused about how borders work within the schengen zone.  I asked the Icelandic ministry of immigration if I could stay in the schengen zone 90 days after my visa ends on a visa free tourist visa.  He said that was fine, his specific message being:

“We refer to your below enquiry. It is correct that you are authorised to stay for 90 visa free days in the Schengen area following your stay in Iceland on the grounds of your long-term visa. Please however be advised that this would be 90 tourist days and not additional remote worker days.”

On the Icelandic remote worker website FAQ (https://work.iceland.is/working/faq-for-remote-work-visa) it says:

“14) Can I travel within Schengen while on Iceland's remote work long-term visa?
Yes. During the long-term visa's validity period, you are entitled to travel within the Schengen area for up to 90 days out of any 180-day period. Be aware that COVID-19 measures may impact your travel plans. When you travel, you must bring with you your passport and evidence that you have been issued a long-term visa, such as a visa sticker in your passport. 

You will all be issued with a multiple entry visa. This means that you can travel to and from the Schengen area as you please. You may also travel within the Schengen area. Note that you will not be able to stay for more than consecutive 90 days in a single Schengen member state.“

So I am wondering, since I am already in the schengen zone, can I go to another country (say Spain) for the rest of my remote worker visa and THEN stay for 90 days on a tourist visa free stay?  I know that there isn’t any passport checks between countries in the schengen zone.  Do you think they would track me leaving Iceland?

Idk has anyone done this before? (Eg finished out the rest of their visa from one schengen country in another, and then stay longer on a tourist visa?). 

Thanks!"

I switched from climbing poles in the field, to working on supporting our equipment. I got a pay raise and am now making 70k a year. However, when I was initially hired I was living in the state of Washington, a state that we had services in. Long story short, my behemoth of a neighbor thought that it'd be a good time for me to die, and I didn't quite agree. I spoke with my boss about moving to the state of Montana for the safety of my family. He allowed it but made me agree that I wouldn't buy/rent until the official move was approved by HR. 8 months later, it was finally approved and I was able to move out of my mother's home and into an apartment. Well, my fiance and I agreed that moving here was a good call considering our situation, but it is a terrible place to live long term. Traveling has always been a dream of ours, but given our past experience (waiting the 8 months for HR) I can't image my employer would be thrilled by the idea. I just applied to a local college to get into computer science/computer programming so I can solidify a remote job for myself so we can do what we want without permission. However, thats another 2-4 years down the road. By then, my 2 year old will be starting school. We are super conflicted on what our next move should be. 

1. Quit the job, find something new, likely take a paycut, lose benefits?

2. Do what my employer wants, stay put and put the traveling idea on hold?

3. Say screw it, not tell them, and just hope they don't find out. (Given the fact that it's a telecommunications company, I am worried that they will notice the IP changes and that I am not where I say I am)

Looking to spend a week or so in late June/early July on a beach somewhere as a “vacation” while working but am struggling to pick a place. I’m trying to find the balance of remote beach location + reliable WiFi + minimal covid restrictions + ideally someplace not in the US (because I like adventures and I’ve been learning Spanish and I’d like to explore someplace new if possible even if I am working half the time while being there).

I’ve been considering the following spots. Please tear this list apart OR suggest spots not on here (for which I will be ridiculously grateful!):

Tamarindo, Costa Rica - because I know there are a lot of DNs with reliable connectivity concerns too and there seem to be a lot of AirBnBs / hotels that advertise fiber optic and are willing to screenshot good upload/download speeds. Time zone is off just enough so I can still enjoy the end of each day. Biggest concern: Costa Rica beaches apparently close at 6pm these days (due to Covid, from what I’ve been reading) so I’m thinking it defeats the purpose of a beach destination if I’m trapped inside anyway. 

Isla Holbox, Mexico - white sand and a small town sounds like everything I want. I’ve heard lots of negative things about getting any type of service there though which is concerning (even at the hotels that advertise free/fast WiFi).

Hawaii - any island, because I know I’ll get reliable internet as long as I’m not on a crazy hike or something. My concern here is working on East Coast time while here… but at least I’ll be done with work early and can enjoy the rest of the day?

Florida Keys - honestly I have not done sufficient research but same time zone and assuming I will be able to get some solid WiFi make this an appealing option. Though less of an adventure all around… which I don’t think I love, but will take just to get away. 

Sayulita, Mexico - I’ve heard there are spots with reliable WiFi, and I don’t really want to be in a real resort town like Puerto Vallarta proper, so this area sounds appealing.

El Zonte, El Salvador - reliable WiFi that will allow me to video call regularly via Teams is my biggest concern here. Seems like the flights are decent enough prices, there are limited covid restrictions, and the area seems like the vibe I am looking for though. 

Open to Caribbean islands or something similar too - anyplace that meets the above criteria (beach + no crazy covid restrictions + good WiFi) that’s not ridiculously touristy is an option at this point. Considered Anguilla but believe they have a mandatory quarantine (last I checked believe it was 10 days), so still need to do more digging here…

——-

Edit: Update

I completely pivoted from all of the above and decided to go to Belize - planning to spend a few days in Ambergris Caye (while I need reliable WiFi) and then moving on to San Ignacio for some jungle activities (where I’m happy to say I won’t need WiFi while I’m there).

o1ahjx,,Where to travel as a DN with chronic digestive issues and a severely limited diet?,"Hi all!

I've recently become a remote worker, and am hoping to transition to DN in January 2022. 

However, I have chronic pancreatitis and ulcerative colitis (IBD), as well as some other unrelated digestive issues.

Due to the aforementioned, I have to eat a diet that is both vegan and paleo, as well as not being able to eat anything even remotely spicy (I can't even have pepper or mild garam masala/curry), can't drink coffee or alcohol, and absolutely have to stay away from anything fatty/greasy (I can only have about 50 grams of fat per day). Processed soy is out of the question (tofu, soy sauce, etc.), so is gluten, and onions and cabbage.

If I eat any of the above, other than a tiny amount ONE TIME (like a piece of cabbage accidentally in my soup once, for example, isn't going to trigger my GI system, but twice, it will), not only am I in severe pain, but I usually vomit... Plus the resulting inflammation last for days, sometimes weeks, and so does the pain, so it's really not worth it.

I do cook a lot, but I don't want to live in a place where I can't eat out at all (cooking every day is exhausting me at this point, as I work full-time or more). 

So, does anyone have any advice on where I could be a DN (ie. live for 3 months) with my health issues? I'm otherwise a healthy and fit person, and as long as I stick to my special diet I tend to be ok (hike/walk a lot, run, etc.).

It doesn't have to be a national cuisine that suits all of my restrictions, but can be a place that has lots of vegan restaurants or paleo restaurants, or even salad bars or soup places with healthy (non-oily, no dairy) soups.

Any suggestions are welcome!"
o1cdpy,4y9m620o,Combination of a digital nomad lifestyle and a classic lifestyle.,"Hi guys, 

I am from Paris and I can work anywhere in the world.

So I want to take advantage of my job and not live all year round in Paris, especially in winter... lol

However, I don't think I would like the typical life of the digital nomad, that is, visiting 30 countries in 2 years. Too much travel, expense, and the feeling of being uprooted...

So here's what I could do:

* live in Gran Canaria (Canary Islands) from November to February, I avoid the French winter ...
* return to Paris in March/April until next November.

Or 2-3 warm destinations in winter, for example Costa Rica and Thailand.

Basically, I would like to live at least 6 months a year in Paris, and I don't want to go to more than 3 countries a year.

Have any of you tried this lifestyle? Wouldn't that be the best compromise between a totally ""normal"" life and the intense lifestyle of a ""typical"" digital nomad?

o290ej,231wmk9j,"Next week, I'm having a promising interview for a job that would allow me to become a digital nomad!","So right now, I live comfortably and have a pretty stable and satisfying job (UX Designer) in an amazing company (think kind of a local Google) in a country that is, unfortunately, goin down the gutter every year (Brazil), and have had, for a few years now, pretty well detailed and calculated plans regarding moving abroad, landing a job in one place of a carefully curated list of 1st-world tech-hubs and working my way towards financial independence while living there.

According to my plans, the actual move abroad was to happen around late next year and, of course, to get these plans out of the paper, I've been doing steady improvements on my portfolio, career, LinkedIn, language skills, etc.

So, maybe it was crazy luck, or maybe I have underestimated these steady improvements, because out of the blue, I've been invited for an interview for a full-remote USA company that seems just awesome, and pays regular north-american tech wages (which is like 6 times what I do here, and I have a waaaaay higher-than-average brazilian wage) and are basically more than enough to live on practically any of the places on my list!

I was caught off guard, not only by the very prospect of having my detailed plans basically fast-forwarded by more than a year, but I also feel a little overwhelmed by thinking that this opportunity might actually be WAY BETTER than my plans - After all, an american wage and a full-remote position would enable me to join your community of digital nomads! (which was, in fact, not something that was in my plans, at all!)

So, I was just looking for a place to share this with people who wouldn't either go jealous or just plain not believe me (an american wage here in Brazil is really unbelievably high, not kidding), and also, to ask for you guys to wish me luck!

If everything goes well, I might be joining this community soon! :D"

o29dd5,,Waiting for Japan to reopen,"So last summer, I booked a round-trip ticket to Tokyo for March of 2021, knowing full well that it could be cancelled and that I could rebook for free. I got an incredible deal -- $415 round trip from Columbus, OH. Their policy only allows free rebookings within a 30-day window of the original date; otherwise, you have to pay the difference in fare.

Well, I imagine Air Canada must be annoyed by my persistence at this point, because I've pushed the trip back five or six times now. They even offered me a full refund recently, which wasn't an option previously, but I said no thanks. And yeah, I could just cough up the difference in fare and rebook for, say, March of next year, but the difference in fare would cost more than my original ticket. I'll call and rebook as many times as it takes, damnit!

I'm currently booked for August 5 - September 16, but I highly doubt this will happen. Assuming my flight is cancelled again, I can push it to September 5, then October 5 if it's cancelled again, and so on. What I'm worried will happen is that Japan will reopen in December or January, and I'll be stuck either going in wintertime or paying the fare difference to push it to spring of next year.

So my question is, if you were in my position, would you cough up the fare difference to avoid going in winter? I plan to bring my work and spend six weeks to two months there, maybe more. I've never been to Japan and don't know how unpleasant the winters are. Any input is appreciated!"

Most posts are stuff like ""I want to work in Mexico for a month, should I tell my boss?"" or ""here is why being a DN is bad"". Then you have endless posts of laptop pictures or simply advertisements for blogs. If that wasn't enough, there seems to be an incredible amount of judgmental people here that feel the constant need to bash everyone for whatever reason. You can find them in way too many posts. They seem to be very keen on making sure everyone is just as miserable as them. Then you have the elitists, terms like ""slumming it"", while also bragging about having amazing corporate jobs and how everyone else is an idiot. How has working for big corporations become the ultimate sign of success for a digital nomad? I am confused. And by the way, with slumming it, they basically mean spending time in a country with a cheap cost of living while also bragging about their corporate job. I have seen several posts about how all DNs in places like Chiang Mai are basically poor scum and that they would never move to such places because they are so rich and successful etc.  

I guess it has to do with Corona making people miserable, but I noticed this trend even before the pandemic started.

Hi all,

I need some tips, tricks and guidance. Our company (situated in the EU) has recently introduced a ""workcation"" policy. Employees are allowed to work remotely from wherever, given work hours are follwowed and quality/quantity of work isn't effected.

I have a colleague who is currently sailing across the Danish sea (our daily meetings are made via video call and lord, am I envious but also so happy for them) and another who is currently finalizing plans to work from Bali.

My problem is: I work in our customer care department. In a EU country. But I want to work remotely from the US for a couple of weeks in the fall (finally see friends and family again after a loonng time). Ultimately, I'd like to work from wherever for at least 3 months a year.

What software or other solutions exist to ensure that even as I am outside of the EU, my clients aren't charged when they call my regular EU work number? I am struggling to find solutions and I am getting overwhelmed by searching all over the internet. If I can overcome this hurdle, I can finally also realize my own ""workcation plans"" and don't have to continue watching my colleagues living a better (work) life. :'(

How do you, or your colleagues, overcome this problem at your work?

Thanks for your help and inputs!"

I don't have a residence here anymore, just a storage locker. My visa status will also expire in the US, which is why I am leaving. 

However, I haven't lived in Canada for a decade, or paid taxes there so  I'm not sure I'm still covered there or if that even matters when I'm out of the  country

I think you have to buy travel health insurance even if you are insured where you live? 

I have an AMEX and a Capital One Visa, so maybe I should call both and see if they offer anything? 

Will likely be traveling for awhile so, I'm hoping I can get some advice! 

**TLDR:** What's everyone using for health insurance when they travel abroad? What are the premiums like? What's the coverage?"
o3n540,ds5fe,Why Puerto Escondido (La Punta / Zicatela) wasn't for me,"Was planning to spend a month in Puerto, but had to cut the trip short to just under a week.

## Terrible Internet
I've read stories of people getting by on the Internet in Puerto, and I don't know how they do it. Fiber optic connections are available (I think the fastest I saw was just under 100 Mbps), but the Internet can go out in the entire town at any moment. This happened to me on my third day, and things didn't come back online until the day after. Cell service seemed to be down too, so hot-spotting as a backup wasn't an option.

If I had to guess, the ones who can get by on the Internet are people who don't need a constant, stable connection. Even when the Internet is ""on"", it can blip out for a few seconds (or minutes) every now and then, which should be fine if you can work offline for a bit and upload videos, send emails, or merge to `main` when things come back online.

My work day is 80% Zoom meetings, so this sadly wasn't an option for me.

## It's not cheap
Or at least the more touristy La Punta / Zicatela areas aren't anyway. As far as food goes, ""international"" spots outnumber ""local"" ones 10 to 1, and meals ran between $4–8 each, easily double/triple that at nicer restaurants. Private AirBnBs run at least $500, upwards 2x/3x that for nicer ones.

I think it's cheaper the closer you get to the center of town, away from the touristy areas.

## Co-working options are limited
The only real option in Zicatela is Selina, and in my opinion, it sucks. The Internet is fast, but it gets super crowded, and it's pricey (\~$12 for a day pass). You're probably better off finding a café — or better yet, working from wherever you're staying if they have a good setup. I hear the Casa Losodeli is better, but that's in Centro.

## The vibe wasn't for me
I've never been, but I imagine La Punta / Zicatela to be a lot like Canggu in Bali. If that sounds exciting to you, you'll probably like it. If it doesn't, you probably won't. Just something to keep in mind.

---

I'd recommend Oaxaca City over Puerto Escondido for those who don't care so much about being near the beach. The Internet is a lot more stable, the food (in my opinion) is better, and you can find accommodations for much cheaper.

I wrote longer posts on both [Puerto Escondido](https://nomadfornow.com/blog/for-digital-nomads-la-punta-zicatela-puerto-escondido-mexico/) and [Oaxaca City](https://nomadfornow.com/blog/for-digital-nomads-centro-oaxaca-mexico/) — feel free to check them out.

o3xad9,dr4xw,Time limit bouncing between Ireland and UK?,"For some reason I can not figure out how to phrase this question in a Googleable way.

In Europe, the Schengen Area is a Common Travel Area.  As a US citizen, I can spend 90 days at a time in France, then I need to leave for 90 days.  And I can't just go back and forth from France to Italy because they are both in the same area for that 90 day clock.  But, for example I can go from France to Ireland because Ireland is in the EU, but not in the Schengen area, so my time in Ireland wouldn't count against time in France.

Ireland and the UK also use the term ""Common Travel Area,"" but everything I have read only applies to UK and Irish citizens, so they seem to be using the term completely differently than the Schengen rules.  And some of what I have read pre-dates Brexit, so I can't quite figure out if any of it still applies.  Lots of travel websites with great SEO make frustratingly vague statements about ""not needing a visa for a short stay.""

So, all of that said my question is actually pretty simple.  Does the UK/IE ""Common Travel Area"" mean that they are a shared clock for a US visitor like France and Italy?  Or can a person bounce back and forth between UK and IE, and is there some optimal strategy for that?  And is there any subtle complication with the Schengen area if a person were doing a circuit between UK, Ireland, and France?"
o40uf7,,Live frugally in India,"Hey everyone! 

I’m in search of a place in India where you can live frugally. 

The criteria will be to live close to the nature, with good food near by and good internet. Hopefully to be able to live on $500/month.

Not too density populated, sounds ironic in India but heard that you can find state with fewer population. 

The place has to be hot all year round. I don't mind humidity.

I heard that Kerala would be a good state for that and someone suggest to seek for semi urban area. However I have no idea on how to begin, researches ect

Help will be welcomed.

o55irz,6fsut6nv,Moving to denmark for 3 months wanting to work remote while abroad,"No, 3 months is not a super long time, but I will be registered as a resident so that I can reaffirm my citizenship. I will be living in smaller towns in DK with family (Ringkobing, Ulfborg) and traveling around the country in Air BnB's by myself.

I currently work at a bar in my town, and tips are great, but seeing as I will be gone for 3 months with no income (and that I'm more than ready to leave the restaurant industry), I would love to find a job i can do remote. 

I have little experience in the workforce out of the restaurant industry, so I could handle doing some data entry temp job, but I plan on delving into the world of design (fashion and or graphic design), marketing or social media management for a cool company. Again, not picky.

o58u91,le96s,How to protect yourself from being locked out of your digital accounts in case of computer / cellphone theft?,"TL;DR: If you lose your computer and MFA device, how do you get back access while traveling?

Firstly a bit of context.  Currently I use a password manager for 99% of my online accounts. Which means that I know pretty much zero passwords for my things. Also, my core accounts (like emails, aws account, etc) have 2FA/MFA setup.  Finally, some services make use of sms or some other method based on phone number to recover accounts (or even as a form of MFA). While this combined increases my overall security, they also poses the risk of getting locked of everything online that I have.

Lets assume a scenario. I am traveling with my light backpack, where I have my travel laptop and I am also carrying my wallet and cellphone. If I get mugged or something, I lose access to my password manager, and two of my MFA devices (Authy and the cellphone number). Without it I am pretty much locked out of my stuff. This is very bad if I am abroad or very far from home, where I have a second computer with Authy and my password manager.

So, my question is, how to make this less catastrophic or even recoverable? In other words, how to get back access to my online stuff? This is not a question on how to not become homeless while travelling, but rather how to get access back to online accounts. I rather not have to figure out in the worst way that I lost access to it all permanently (or that I have to go to customer support to maybe get my access back).

I have though about this for a while and I haven't found a good solution. But I have a few ideas on how to improve the situation, but they are not ideal. How do you guarantee that you won't lose access to your online stuff?"

I was only going swimming for a few minutes, I thought it'd be fine. It wasn't. By the time I came back, my backpack was gone. Along with my keys, wallet, cellphone, and airpods. Crap.

The Barbados Police Force have been slow and inefficient and the Embassy wasn't much help either. My phone has gone dead and I'm unable to track it. I've lost my stuff for good. Time to get a new phone.

o59rj2,awsznt5y,Does a digital nomad lifestyle always mean you can’t do freelance work in the country you’re currently located in without breaking into their tax system?,"Many (though I realise not all) freelancers pay tax on their income to their home country, so they don’t have to contend with the various tax systems of all the different countries they go to, right? But as far as I understand, most countries retain rights to any income sourced in that country. 

So does that mean if you went to Thailand, and did some freelance work for a company based in Thailand, you’d have to register to pay tax in Thailand just to pay the tax on that one job? Even if the rest of all your income comes from clients based in the US, Canada, whatever? 

I guess it’s not a huge deal but I just want to make sure I understand this correctly. How do people deal with this? Do you just actively avoid taking on clients in the country you’re currently in?"

o5ddms,,Isn't it insane how most of Europe is now cheaper to AirBnB than Mexico?!,"I don't even understand the logic, but staying in the very centre of Budapest, Prague, Warsaw, etc. costs sometimes HALF the price of staying in Oaxaca.

Obviously places like Paris, London, or Berlin are much pricier, and therefore the exception, but honestly MOST cities in Europe are now more affordable in terms of accomodation than, for example, Mexico City, Oaxaca, Lima, Cusco, etc. (Please note that I am only comparing cities with infrastructure and lots to do, and comparing staying in the BEST part of each city, not neighbourhoods far from activities, beach towns or off-the-beaten-path places). 

When did this happen?! I just wanted an affordable place to stay for a few months, IN THE CITY as I'm not making the ""big bucks"" right now and I am so sick of living out in the boonies... Looks like it'll be Europe lol. 🤷 

Never, ever did I think that the ""budget"" option would be Europe... Wish I could go somewhere closer for the same price, and I really would prefer Central/South America, but it's obviously not possible for me to afford it for 3-6 months...

Following this group since a while and learned a lot. Also read a post by a guy who also asked if hes ready and will do the same with a little extend to my personal fit.

Some Key Facts about me:

* 26yr
* German/Swiss
* Self Employed  in ecommerce with 3 fulltime freelancers
* Budget 1000-1300$ pm
* 12k $ savings (savings is the wrong word, every penny I own)
* Want to go at october/november
* Vaccinated

&#x200B;

Countries/cities I have in mind:

* Chiang Mai
* Bali
* Da Nang
* Cebu
* SEA in general, I think Latin america is too expensive for now
* Buenos Aires (inflation makes a great deal is that true?)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At first sorry for my not perfect english I hope this post gives some value for other people too and I wish some thoughts and criticism on your side to evaluate my decision better.

I have my business model since a few years but processes with growth since maybe 6 month+. Im pretty accurate with my budget and track every spending since years, however im not frugal. Im living between germany and switzerland under 1300€ (insurance, rent, water everything included) but Im working from home, so not much cool lifestyle. Its hard to beat the prices for food and beer in a german supermarket so more money saving is not the motivation to move. 

Motivation for lifestyle are 

* higher lifestyle at the same budget
* more discipline for work through coworking space
* new people and business models
* massages
* girls & dating 
* tasty food 
* driving scooter

At the screenshot you can see my chaotic excel in german (just an eye catcher)

Since a few months I scan all paper to the cloud, new passport, international driver license, and switch everything (processes with banks, health insurcance, taxes) on a digital way to prepare myself for digital nomad lifestyle. Im not really there financially where I want to be with my business (I need 5k€ gross revenue pm and I have 4k) but I would say im ready not but there are some points:

&#x200B;

Without Covid I would catch a flight and go to chiang mai. But the problem are the visa restrictions.

Thailand max 60 days, the 90 days multiple entry ends at september. Where can I go then? Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Phillies, all cheap countries are closed. East europe is cold and lonely in winter I think I would get depressed there. No cheap coworking spaces, scooters or massages there. african countries like Tansania etc. is more expensive and have shitty apartments.

Any Idea where I could go after 90 days thailand? 

Do you think Im ready? I think the 1000$ pm SEA lifestyle didnt include Covid restrictions.

Do you think Covid Cases will rise in SEA? Flying from healing europe to SEA in the new quarantine I would hit my head against a wall.

&#x200B;

I hope my thoughts in this post are not too chaotic. Maybe I just want to have some conversation with people who lives this lifestyle already because I think Im very close to live it too and just need some more thoughts.

I'm looking at it for a few reasons cause on the other hand I read that Jakarta has cheap lodging. Where you can get a fully furnished for $200 to $300 a month with good internet. Plus the food, people said it's good and cheap as well. With a wide range of options from Indian to western. 

In addition to that, the locals in Jakarta appear to be friendly and open-minded, so I'm wondering why not trying in it for 3 to 6 months.

And after reading some of your posts it seems that Bali or Lombok is catered for ""woke & hipsters"" and after visiting Chiang Mai trust me, this crowd gets old very quickly. Jakarta despite being an international business place appears more authentic and cheaper too.

What do you guys think about it? Thought the same too? or even you lived there. Please let me know your returns of experiences.

I always encourage people to try new things and go out and make the life they want, to not be passive. So without too much of an intro like a Pinterest recipe, here is how to make friends as a DN.

&#x200B;

**Making friends:**

First follow rules 1 and 2 and you will be fine, otherwise here is a guide to making friends and expanding your experiences.

&#x200B;

**Recreationally**\- Find things that you like, you can’t just have drinking and partying as your hobby your whole life, I mean you can but wow most of those people you meet in their 50s acting 20 are not living the healthiest and happiest lifestyle. I will give you some examples from my own journey. I like to scuba dive, it is a very easy to make friends and divers tend to be a very chill group of people. There are sometimes local groups or clubs, and many places in the world have dive shops. Other things you can try as hobbies related to water- kite boarding, skim boarding, surfing, snorkeling, etc. I like spear fishing as well, quite a few times I have seen someone walking in the street with a spear and have initiated a conversation and been invited to go and made friends.  Go to the local gym, quite often it is a great place to meet new people and most are very friendly, though never put equipment back in its place.

Hiking and yoga groups are relatively common and easy to find. Again these are generally very chill people and often know the area. I also like to dirt bike and will stop someone with a trailer full and ask if I can join which has resulted in some great experiences I would not have otherwise had. Other sports you can try- volleyball, Soccer which is literally everywhere, basketball. Learn to dance! Salsa, bachata, these are amazing life skills to have and a great way to make new friends.

To be a well-rounded individual I think one needs a few different hobbies in life, so as not to be labeled or self-labeled as just one thing that becomes your identity. IE hockey is life/drinking is life type of person.

&#x200B;

**Professionally**\- there are professional groups in many places you will visit. This is another great way to make local connections both personally and professionally. Check out coworking spaces, often they are majority foreigner and people often would rather talk to someone else about their work than do their own, look for folks without headphones on if you are feeling social. Many DNs I meet exclusively hang out with other foreign DNs, please work to make local friends, I know it is hard but it is worth it.

&#x200B;

A note on language- my personal position is that you will have a way better time in a place if you try and learn the language. For me it has been difficult to learn Spanish but I have been working hard enough to have conversations and make friends who only speak Spanish. This has made a world of difference from my travels in the past and while difficult, is worth the effort 1000x over. I practice for an hour a day with things like Italki, Duolingo, Coffee break Spanish podcast, Fluent addon, etc. Learning a language is like losing weight, slow and steady and takes a long time to get results, literally grinding.

&#x200B;

Honestly if you have never done any of these potential hobbies, you will have an amazing time just trying them out in the places you visit I promise. Check out facebook events/groups, [meetup.com](https://meetup.com), Airbnb Experiences, etc

Would be great to hear other successful ways to make new friends you have used, and interesting hobbies other people have.

&#x200B;

Hobbies and activities listed: Scuba diving, snorkeling, spear fishing, kite boarding, surfing, skim boarding.

Volleyball, soccer, basketball, baseball, hiking, mountain/road/dirt biking, yoga, dancing, rock climbing, hang gliding, para-gliding"
o6gd5a,14l500,"[discussion] Freelance coders who work on big contracts (above $5000), who are your clients?","I'm trying to understand where to put my attention in searching for bit contracts.

I deliver a good product and really love to code but I feel like I'm going in the wrong direction because the networking effect doesn't work for me. Even though my clients are satisfied with the result I almost never get to be introduced to someone they know.

It may be because I focus on small gigs that are more like impulse purchases and they don't have a constant stream of coding work.

I just want to know more about the specifics of freelancers who get big contracts:

* Are your clients mostly with a business background and you deliver a complete product or are you hired by other coders/tech people to contribute to some bigger project?
* I recently read it is common to charge a daily rate and not an hourly rate. For me, it seemed reasonable as it is more predictable for both the freelancer and the client. What's your take on that? Do you charge a daily rate?
* Do you mostly work with startups, or corporations, or local businesses?
* How did you get your first big contract? We all know that it's all networking but what's your story in particular?

o7hr3n,3ppn0p5m,Planning long-term (over a month) stays,"Hey!

I'm planning to start traveling soon while staying in each new place for a month or two. Since I have never done so before, I've been doing some research and want to understand the best way to book places long-term using Airbnb.

So far I see 2 options:

* Book a hotel for a few days, and use this time to search for an Airbnb place while being in a destination country/city/place.
* Book an Airbnb place right away (long-term) 

I understand that the first option tries to protect me from ""scams"" (by which I mean places that are different from what is advertised or that I find not fitting for whatever reason).

But somehow, I don't see how that would help me, unless I want to search for a long-term place using local agencies or contacts (which I don't want to use, at least for starters).

Here's a (hypothetical) scenario:

* I contact an Airbnb host, check all the details, we confirm that I'm an appropriate guest, and book a place.
   * The way I see it, I cannot check the place out in person before the booking (according to this: [https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/127/asking-to-visit-before-booking](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/127/asking-to-visit-before-booking))
   * So, to actually verify the place I want to stay in with my own eyes, I have to book a place and perform a check-in.
   * This point kind of eliminates the need to book a temporary hotel first and look for Airbnb while being located in a destination country.
* I arrive to the place and find it unacceptable (for whatever reason). 
   * According to this, long-term stays will always have the same cancellation policy ([https://www.airbnb.com/home/cancellation\_policies#long-term](https://www.airbnb.com/home/cancellation_policies#long-term)), and to get a full refund I have to cancel within 48 hours of booking and **before** checking in.
   * Here, the booking while being located at the destination country would have helped me if I could inspect the place, and that would not be considered a ""check-in"" action. (because of 48 hours constraint)
   * But the problem is - I think the very act of stepping into the property would act as a ""check-in"", at least this article ([https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/248/if-something-is-wrong-at-checkin](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/248/if-something-is-wrong-at-checkin)) and other articles in ""Checking-in"" category imply so. I assume check-in procedure can be defined differently by each host, but I don't think there is a definitive ""Complete Check-In"" button anywhere in the Airbnb app.
* I understand that the cancellation is not the only way to go. First thing is always to talk with the host and see if issue(s) can be sorted out, but I would always prefer to check the place first in person to decide on the spot, since that's the most bulletproof way to make sure the the place fits me. (e.g. no sources of loud sounds in the nearby area, which host cannot do anything about, e.g. construction areas)
   *  I would not go that far for short stays, but for long-stays option I'd like to make extra sure... :)

I hope I was able to convey my reasonings clear enough :)

Please help me understand how to approach this better?

I assume I might be missing some details due to my lack of knowledge and experience, which might make all of my reasonings pointless, so I would appreciate any input.

TLDR:

* Is it ok to contact the host before the booking, explain my situation and ask to have a look at the property before the booking, and book (and check-in) only if everything looks acceptable? Is it a practice that is appropriate to be used? Or can it backfire?
   * Being able to contact the host and personally have a look at the property the same day or next day would make booking a hotel for a few days a valid option.

Thanks in advance! :)"
o7i94u,ipfrq,I feel unskilled enough to be a digital nomad,I have been a server since I was 16 and I’ve been able to travel a couple long term trips.

I have been planning to do this since last year and am now finally able to do it. The problem is, i have never expected myself to reach up to this point with all the challenges of bureaucracy, immigration and travel restrictions brought about by the pandemic and so I did not plan out the moment after reaching mexico as a digital nomad. I have expected that somewhere along the way of my journey, something was gonna go wrong and I will not really reach my destination.  But now I am here hahahaa. I am at a loss. I am also a solo traveler (fully vaccinated) 

Any recommendations you can give me that you would have done as a first time digital nomad? I was thinking of meeting other like-minded individuals and join fb groups in puerto vallarta but it seems like most weekend meetups there are more entrepreneur-focused and i might just be theres be out of place as I am a permanent employee (not an entrepreneur) who is privileged enough to work remotely. 

Also, i am a POC from a third world country and I have noticed that when I was solo traveling and staying in hostels around the world (prior to digital nomading), most people tend to to be cliqueish and just interact among themselves, particularly the caucasian groups or the ""first world"" groups (dont really understand why) and it wasnt a very positive experience. They can be polite but it seems like you are treated as a shadow among social interactions even though i speak fluent english."

We are from the Netherlands and he moved to Canary Island a month ago.

I notice that the place that I live in doesn't have many like minded people.

So what's the best place to be in as an entrepreneur?

I want to be surrounded by like minded people. I want to be a better person and entrepreneur and i'm looking for a place in which I can achieve those goals. I want to live in a place where there is a large group of people who are striving to be a better version of themselfs... I want to go to a place were people are hungry for succes and don't settle for mediocrity.

I've followed this sub for a while, planning and such. The last piece of my puzzle is the work station and I know there are frequent posts about the zenscreens and how to circumvent the need for multiple larger monitors with virtual desktops and so on. This is not about that. I have been experimenting with various setups for while and I know my needs and limitations. Also, my aim is not to hop between countries every few weeks, so I don't need to be ultra portable.

I know some of you are lugging larger monitors around, so share your gear!

I'm open to all ideas, but my initial thoughts about requirements are as such:

* 21-24inch
* narrow / little bezel (because why not and for potential dual setup)
* Light and thin
* Undecided on ports (I'll be using a X1 carbon G9 with thunderbolt 4 and likely a small travel hub)
* No specifics for stand, because I'll likely use arms / mounts
* VESA mountable
* Ports: USB-C or HDMI
* No battery
* IPS panel preferable

I’m a sales engineer and am on customer calls all the time often presenting to a room full of people.

1) A private space to take said calls
2) high speed internet

1. I need to be able to send money (preferably via bank transfer) to ""frontier"" markets cheaply.  This is where my business operates, so it's where half or more of my expenses are. 
2. I need to be able to send money to US bank accounts cheaply.  This is where I pay salaries, so it's the other half of my expenses.  By cheaply, I mean 1% of the wire amount or less.
3. I need to be able to accept international wire transfers cheaply.  My customers are exclusively large institutions, in many different countries.

\#3 is where the standard small business products just don't work for me.  I don't need to accept electronic payments or write checks or even have an ATM card.

o9eb3n,12e7zz,Income whilst in-between projects,"Hi all,

I'm looking for some advice for how you continue to earn money in-between projects...

I have a particularly tricky situation where I'm on a visa that restricts me to working only 20hrs a week. Often the projects I get are large in size and require all of these hours per week and so getting a second job isn't a viable option as it compromises my ability to work on well-paying contracts/projects when they come in.

I am working on developing some passive income streams but naturally that doesn't happen overnight so I'm wondering what you might suggest as a very casual (ie. do on and off when needed) form of income even if it's things like data entry or more admin kinda tasks. Are there some good websites for this?

I've looked into sights like [fiver.com](https://fiver.com/), [upwork.com](https://upwork.com/), [airtasker.com](https://airtasker.com/) etc. however I have 2 issues with these and that's:

1. Rates are often very low and by doing these jobs it impacts the overall income levels for the freelance market which I don't really agree with.
2. There's a lot of competition against people who already have lots of reviews which means it's not a quick income solution for people not already established on the platform.

My skills are in photography, web design and e-learning. I have thought about perhaps offering tutoring - has anyone done this with much success? But again with this it involves relying more on people wanting to be tutored whereas I'm more looking for something where I can just like log in, do some work and get paid for it. 

Open to any suggestions!

Quick intro: I'm 29, currently live in Argentina, I'd studied softeware engineering and I've working as a software developer (backend) for ~5 years now (I code since I was 16 though), I'd never done freelance, I've have a cat (which will go if I go) and I'd never travelled alone (always with my ex partner, friends or family).

With that been said I'm curious about:

- Which is the best way to handle the money? International bank, crypto, stocks, or something else?

- I know this depends on the living way, the place where you're living but which is the minimum salary per month you would recommend to have?

- You guys have a safe amount stashed just in case you want to go stop or something happens? If so, do you recommend a minimum amount?

- Do you ever feel lonely, miss your family, friends?

- Is language a huge barrier? I only speak spanish and I try to defend myself on english (you probably know the last one by now)

- Is this lifestyle suited for a pet?

- Is it possible to earn some real money in the process without putting a lot of effort to control your spending?

- Do you think it's late for me to do it? I don't plan to do it all my life, at least not atm. I'm the classic guy that wants a family and kids in the old fashion way, but I'm sure that if I do not try this I'll regret.

- I'm thinking on doing a 2 month trip to south asia to try out first without going all in. Do you guys think it could be a waste of money or that it will worth it?

I subleased my apartment for a year and it will become my responsibility again in November, even if that means officially moving out.

However, I keep finding myself mourning the fact that my trip will be ending in November. Now of course I could move out and continue doing what I'm doing — but I've been thinking about how I could have my cake and eat it too.

My description of ""having my cake and eating it too"" as a digital nomad would be to have a home that I could inhabit when it's convenient for me. And when it's not, I could rent out. This resolves the sadness that my trip is ending and makes it feel less of a ""once in a lifetime trip"" and more like ""the first of many"". If owning a home and renting it intermittently was legitimately an option, then I could transition into a DN anytime I wanted for however long I wanted without relying on the permission of a landlord. I know this is all easier said than done and could take years to actualize, but I'm curious how many of you out there do something similar and what you've learned from it. Any advice or input?Thanks in advance!

Edit: Also it should be noted that I live in California and my rent is $1500. Handing $1500 to a landlord every month is fine, but this trip has made me reconsider where I'm putting that money that could serve me better across time. That's why I've considered buying vs. my old mentality of just renting. Also $1500 is scratch in California, so I likely won't be looking for property there haha."

I’ll be in the same time zone, available for work at the same time, etc. Nothing I access is confidential or privvy to any privacy laws and my contract doesn’t say I need to be in the US, but we do need to be able to access a company server via VPN. I don’t care about my employer being able to “see” where I am (it’s a big company and IT doesn’t know who I am) but do you think my access to the VPN could be blocked because I’m outside the US? Should I just tell my employer (I inexplicably really don’t want to)"

oar8rr,7j1tw6vp,Digital Nomad community +1,"Hello fellow nomads. I'm 27 y.o. guy from Ukraine who is finally ready to set off and wouldn't mind an advice for a solo trip. But first, here's my story

&#x200B;

I've been really depressed this winter and somehow managed to get myself back into a happy state by starting my Business Automation freelance project, getting back into the gym, getting a longboard and doing in-country trips. All this time I've been in the relationships, which I ended in May, since I couldn't feel her loving me anymore and she definitely couldn't make that step. At 1st I thought I was fine and we both agreed it was a good move, but a few days ago she came back to take her stuff and the place started to feel too empty after, so that I can't stand it anymore

&#x200B;

This whole situation has been a good kick. I've had plans on selling my ""battlestation"" PC, other things that I own that always make me question spontaneous trips and now I'm half way to getting rid of these and settle of. I sold my PC, TV, headsets, grill, chair and a few other things that I never needed much. I will probably end up having my close friends selling the rest for me as there will definitely be something left while I'm planning to leave on this weekend or start of the next week

&#x200B;

Might look like I'm trying to runaway from something and I will definitely agree that partially it's true. But for the past month I badly lacked motivation to do my freelancing stuff and my main work duties, which normally total to 11-12 hour workday. I'm waking up tired, sleeping badly etc. 

I've started meeting people from Couchsurfing in Kyiv to share experience, but they typically visit Ukraine for a few days and what they do is different from a digital nomad life, so I definitely need your advice:

&#x200B;

\- What countries(cities) should I visit?

I'm working with US market mainly, so the closer the time-zone is to US the better. Also, I love nature, hiking so it doesn't necessarily have to be something big with amazing infrastructure. Having just a good internet connection is fine for me

&#x200B;

\- How do I not get myself into trouble?

What should I avoid? What type of places should I not visit? 

&#x200B;

I'm earning 2k+ from my main work and 500-1000 USD from my freelance + have some backup savings. Pretty sure that will be enough. Please, advice how to stay within my budget and what are the expenses you didn't expect to have while travelling?

&#x200B;

Have you had any hosts instead of renting a flat? Where did you find them? Is it better to just rent a place?

 

I will probably finish the post here, as it's getting too huge, but I'd love to read any other advice you have and will be looking into the comments often for the next 2-3 days

&#x200B;

Thank you for reading this and good luck to all of us :)"

Here's the [WIP Notion doc](https://www.notion.so/yihwan/Coliving-Compared-3eab74d02baa4b54b845fb1b402336c4). 

I was inspired by [Oasa's positioning map](https://oasa.co/coliving-positioning-map) and was surprised by how many coliving options I'd never heard of before. Before, I was only really aware of three (WiFi Tribe, Remote Year, and Hackers Paradise) besides the ones that function more like short-term apartments (Common, Sonder, etc.). 

I wanted to organize these options in a way that'd be useful to others (fancy visualizations and such), but that turned out to be a lot harder than I thought. For example, I know a lot of us probably care about price, but clean price comparisons were difficult across locales, listings, etc. I'm not sure what other criteria people care the most about. 

So far, the only editorializing I've done is grouping options as either focusing on ""Accommodation"" or ""Community."" I've also marked the options that are only available in single locations/countries. 

What else would be helpful to see? How could we compare prices in a logical way? Have you tried any of these (or other) options? Let me know!"

* O2 claim they don't cut you off no matter how long you're abroad.
* EE cut you off at 30 days abroad.
* 3 cut you off at 60 days abroad.

\---

Hey, can you recommend any decent eSim options for a British nomad?

My GiffGaff physical SIM has been great - I've reliably received those dumb, outdated SMS messages that some dinosaur banks require, anywhere in the world for four years.

Plus, I have a fixed number - so I can register for various government apps that demand a UK phone number - as I run a UK business and maintain tax residency there while I travel the world.

However, it'd be great to shift my UK number to my eSim so that I can keep the physical SIM on my iPhone 12 for local SIM cards.

I'm likely to spend most of my time in Bali, going forwards.

Here are the options I'm aware of - none of which are great.

* **3 Go Roam.** Last time I checked they cut you off at around 60 days abroad, which is utterly useless.
* **Vodafone.** I believe there's a hack to register for a 30 day contract on eSim then cancel?
* [**eSIM.net**](https://eSIM.net)**.** Looks dodgy and has bad reviews on TrustPilot
* **Google Fi.** Not available outside America and they (famously) cut people off for extensive travel - so please stop recommending it.
* Various weird digital SMS providers that I do NOT trust for critical banking services.

I'm happy to get a contract-only eSIM and pay £20-30/month - but it looks like most (or all?) providers cut you off if you're out of the country for long?

Weird. I don't even want data abroad - I JUST want a fixed, reliable UK number to receive SMS and phonecalls.

Tips appreciated!

Thanks"

My current career aspirations don’t aim towards teaching, but I could aspire towards teaching at a university eventually.

I have degrees in history and teaching. Im confident I could obtain a  teaching job.

Most I recognize will take time to fulfill. I currently make $45k salary w benefits at a think tank/journalism, with room to grow. Currently remote, but may not be and I’m concerned how sustainable it could be with almost a 12 hr difference. 

Ideally I would like to make around what I make now, mainly to fulfill those concerns I listed above.

The career aspirations are another thing. I enjoyed working with college students. But I definitely prefer my current field. I’ve entertained overseas English language journalism gigs.

The specs are great, I am a software developer so it's a nice beast to have, but how can I secure it? I have never used a lock, would that be useful?

Can I somehow disguise it as a shittier laptop? I have never traveled with anything expensive, my old laptop is around 500$ and I don't care if it gets stolen or not.

How do you secure your laptops?

Update: Thanks y'all, I canceled the order, I'm sticking with my old laptop with Ubuntu. 

Really useful comments, made me realize  it's more important for me to have peace of mind than a very nice tool to use. I'll copy here some of your insights, they were very useful:

\- laptop skin + stickers to hide the brand

\- insurance (it's not enough to buy it, you have to be able to afford it in the long term)

\- laptop locks

\- hide it as much as possible (really dig the dirty laundry bag)

\- be alert while in coffee shops, don't leave it unattended

\- stay in safer places. This, coupled with the insurance thing, convinced me lifestyle creep will happen if I decide to own an expensive laptop.

\- be prepared to lose it anyway - I liked this one the most

Stay safe :)

od1l60,a310hadn,Ideal EU country for freelancers?,"Hi,

I’d like to ask your advice on living as a freelancer in Europe.

The wife and I are both translators and looking to relocate to an EU country to live and work. We are currently living in Hungary, which is not bad, but we’d like to experience different places too.

We make a decent but not extravagant amount of money (over 60-70k but under 100k EUR per year, depending on some factors) and have no kids yet. We are interested in countries that offer good tax schemes for self-employed workers.

We are both quite flexible, have years of experience of living abroad and speak foreign languages too so this wouldn’t be the first time for either of us to move to a foreign country. But it will be the first time we move abroad together.

Ideally, we’d like to move to an EU member state (we are both EU citizens). Other than that, we are quite flexible. Preferably, this new place will have no worse infrastructure/quality of life/health care facilities than that of Hungary, so we are looking to relocate to countries that are located to the West of Hungary.

Based on our research, we found that Scandinavia, the Benelux, Austria, and Germany have high taxes. Spain is nice, I’ve lived there for a while but back then I was an employee. From what I heard, being an autónomo there costs an arm and a leg. Italy is also an option with the new Growth Decree – any experiences with that scheme?

We haven’t done much research on Portugal or the Baltic states yet but I heard only Estonia would be ideal as Latvia and Lithuania are not that advanced with regards to entrepreneur/freelancer culture.

As of now, the most likely candidates are Czechia or Slovenia – nice, developed countries with a high quality of life and the cost of living, while it is higher than in Hungary, is still certainly lower than in Western Europe. I also heard there was a good tax scheme for freelancers in Slovenia where one has to pay 20% tax on only 20% of one’s income, effectively making the total tax rate 4%. This sounds almost too good to be true – is there a catch?

What would you recommend based on our circumstances and experiences? Did we miss any places that are good for freelancing expats, or did we get something wrong during our research so far?

Any tips or advice would be very much appreciated.

Cheers"

My goal was to create a short list of countries that could be investigated further, which had a low cost of living and high quality of life.  So, I averaged as much data as I could and filtered for the above-average values. I'll go into my reasoning a bit below (some of it will be taken from the original post; I hope that's okay!), but the ""short list"" of countries I came up with is in the tl;dr.

I would love to hear any feedback on how to make the data better or improve my methods!

**Why Take This Approach?**

A little while ago, I was inspired by *Noise*, a recent book by Cass Sunstein, Daniel Kahneman, and Olivier Sibony. It had some great arguments about reducing decision ""noise"" by averaging multiple judgements, rather than simply attempting a single judgement on your own when faced with a large amount of data. I had noticed that when I tried to incorporate a lot of data into my models, what I felt were the fair weights changed day-by-day-- I'd come back a day later and review my formula, and decide I'd made a terrible mistake (what was I thinking?) and re-adjust. Rinse and repeat. It was a lot of fun, but I didn't have confidence that what I was doing ever used the right weight, and the choice of weights could change results dramatically.

Another problem is that sources all used different scales: How do I know that the definition of ""Free"" used by Democracy Index is the same ""Free"" according to the Human Freedom Index? On the cost of living-side, [commonly used resources sometimes provide whacky results](https://raywoodcockslatest.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/123-low-cost-cities/). I can only imagine this is made worse after a global pandemic where travel between countries was limited.

**Methods**

All available data for 2018+ in the realm of quality of living and cost of living was aggregated and normalized. Additionally data that directly related to the target result was aggregated as a separate category. Averages across years were used when possible.

Quality of life data was grouped into buckets: Development (a country's level of development), Life Expectancy, Safety and Stability, Freedom, Environment (risk of natural disaster, effects of climate change, etc.).

Cost of living was also grouped into buckets: GDP per Capita, Cost of Living, Wealth, and Income (income was eventually removed as a factor due to high correlation and low data size).

Direct data (related directly to the desired end result) was grouped into buckets as well: Migration (net), Happiness, Expat surveys, and Overall (for resources aiming for an overall score).

No source was allowed to provide more than one value in cost of living or quality of life (a total of two data sets max), and the data set that could reasonably be expected to be the closest indicator to the desired metric was chosen for each source. Sources that retrieved data from other sources were not included-- only the root source. However, if a source incorporated data from another source and performed its own analysis, or merged multiple sources, it was incorporated.

To aggregate the data, each field was given equal weighting, and a average was formed for each of quality of life, cost of living, and direct measures. If no value was provided by a data set for a particular country, 0 was used, so long as the total percentage of N/A values was less than 25%. If it was greater than 25%, an aggregated score of N/A was assigned, due to insufficient data. Because Quality of Life bears much similarity to the Direct measures, one score aggregation aggregates both.

Data is broken into three tables: Aggregator Raw (the raw aggregation data), Aggregator Trimmed (where some data was removed due to being too small or having a high correlation with a lot of other sources), and Aggregator Trimmed w/Continent Mean (the same data as the Aggregator Trimmed table, except that N/A values for countries with less than 25% N/A values was replaced with the average for the continent instead of using the international average). The continental mean was used for the last set in an effort to cut down on potential regional/ethnic/racial bias in the ratings.

**tl;dr: I collected a ton of data on quality of life and cost of living, averaged the scores, and created a list of countries that could be suitable for investigating further to retire or work remotely in. There are many ways to filter the data, but the list I came up with is:**  **Albania, Argentina, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Georgia (including Abkhazia and South Ossetia), Jamaica, Mexico, Mongolia, Paraguay, Peru, Serbia (including Kosovo), South Africa, and Ukraine.**  


Edit: Corrected some mistakes within the list."
of9a5n,5u9byvwf,Working Remotely Abroad for a Temporary Period,"Hi all, I have a question about working abroad remotely in a foreign country. I want to work abroad temporarily for \~30 days in a city in Europe starting next month. This country is currently accepting vaccinated tourists from the US and my company has an office in the city I plan to stay in. I'm a US citizen but I don't have working rights/visa in the foreign country - I would just be on a tourist visa upon landing that is valid for 90 days. I've considered work hours and manager approval for working remote, which both shouldn't be an issue (I have already been working remotely during the entire pandemic).

My company supports remote work in a countries where they have an office as long as it doesn't surpass 2 weeks per year under normal non-covid circumstances (currently extended to 4 weeks due not being back in office yet), but are a little vague on the visa rules so I'm wondering if anyone has had any experience doing this or knows about the laws. I've heard of other people doing this during the pandemic or even before, but I can't find concrete info on whether this is legal.

**Tl;dr:** Can I work remotely in a foreign country (one that is currently accepting tourists obviously) ***temporarily*** for 30 days on a tourist visa? My company has an office in the city I would stay in in that country."

My husband and I are both employed FT by remote-friendly startups. I have a work-issued laptop (MacBook Air 13-inch, 2015) and a personal laptop (MacBook Air 13-inch, 2020). It seems unwise to only bring my work laptop with me while abroad...I don't want to do things like manage personal finance, streaming movies/TV etc.) on an employer-issued laptop. I also like the idea of having a backup to my work laptop in case it craps out while we're abroad.

At the same time, it seems like lugging 2 laptops around the world might be a pain. We won't be backpacking it/staying in remote places, so we'll have a secure place to keep our belongings most of the time.

Am I overthinking this? Is it common to travel with more than one laptop? Any advice appreciated!

oga3zb,y5h1y,Work Remotely or Take a break from work to travel,"Hi everyone, 

As the title states I’m stuck deciding between working remotely or simply taking an extended leave from my job and traveling.

I am currently remote until the end of the year and my plan to this point has been to work remotely from South America starting in September, through December. I would come back and work at home for Jan&Feb, then take a sabbatical in March for 3 months to Asia. After that I will be settling with my gf when she begins grad school in June.

My company offers 2 types of extended leave, a 3 month sabbatical (keep benefits), or up to 12 months l leave(can come back sooner, but there are no benefits, basically just have a job when I return).

After some thought I’ve considered taking the 12 month leave and using 8-9 months of it (September-May). This would allow me to be completely free and enjoy the time traveling with my gf. Although, it’s hard for me to think of going that long without any sort of income. I have enough money saved up that I could make it work with wiggle room, but I would burn through basically all of my savings (not including 401k/IRA/Investments). Taking the leave also wouldn’t have massive repercussions on my career as I spoke to someone else who did this already.

I know this sub is for DN just want to get some input from people on the difficulties of working while traveling throughout South America. The opportunity cost for going 5 months without salary + benefits is probably close to $35k after-tax."

oge5j0,zoto7,(US based) First time nomad to explore the US. Seeking help/guidance,"Hey all, 

I'm sorry in advance for the long post and I hope it doesn't break any rules as I'm not sure if anyone has posted something similar and I want to make sure I explain myself the best I can. I assume someone may have already done something like this and If they have, a link would be awesome. So thanks in advance for any guidance you may provide! :)

This is the deal. Thanks to COVID I've become a fully remote software engineer. I'm fully vaxxed and I think it's time to travel and do something new/wild/different/exciting in my life. I have a flex schedule so as long as my work is done it doesn't matter the time and as long as I have an internet connection it doesn't matter where I am. 

So far this is what I'm planning or at least thinking about. I'm currently in an apt with a lease until April 2022. For which I've started to plan this journey, so when my lease ends, all I'd have to do is sell most of my stuff, put some into storage, pack my clothes and few other items, and start the journey. 

I'm based out of Boise, ID I'm 34yo single, no kids or SO. Though I think I'm a bit old for this, I feel that because I'm finally remote it's now or never as I have nothing holding me back and I don't want to look back and regret that I didn't do it due to fear.

That being said. I'm not sure where or how to start. So far my thought is that I'll drive to a new location on a weekend starting from Idaho and make my way down the west coast and just start going around the different cities/towns and keep going until I make my way to most (if not all) of the US. Depending on where I am, I may spend a week or two and maybe up to a month. Could stay longer if the place is awesome or if I just want to see more. 

My main concern at this point is the the cost. Obviously I have my own personal debts which I'm paying off. Thankfully I get paid fairly well, so given that I won't have rent and would have to cancel some of the memberships and other conveniences, I'd have nearly $3k a month as ""disposable"" income. Obviously I have to consider some expenses such as gas, car maintainance, food, and lodging. Having the last one be the most expensive of it all. Although I'm not sure if there are other expenses I'm not accounting for that I should consider. 

Another thing I'm not sure about is how will my taxes be affected since I won't have a ""permanent"" residence And How would my car insurance work for the same reason. As you see I will keep my car as I travel and since it's a small hatchback I have to reach a fairly minimalistic lifestyle to comfortably live of whatever I carry in it. 

That's more or less what I've been thinking about and the background to give you somewhat of an idea of what I'm hoping to accomplish. So I guess the few things I'd like to ask and will repeat some of what I mentioned above:

-Where do you look for a place to live/stay that are relatively affordable or even free?

-How do you determine the time you'll stay in a place?

-How do you plan your route and next destination?

-How do I handle my taxes and car insurance?

-What items are key for me to carry since I'd have to be fairly minimalistic? 

-Does it feel pretty lonely? How do you deal with it? How do you go about meeting people? Have you even met your SO on the road or even tried dating? What was that like?

-How do you keep active? Can you maintain a fairly balanced and healthy diet when being on the road as often?

-what items should I acquire? A bike, tent, sleeping bag, or something of the like? 
 
Though I have several goals and reasons for doing this. Ultimately I want find myself, see what I'm capable of, and maybe find a place I could potentially settle down in and call home. 

I have no idea what else I'm missing in questions or things that's are super important to keep in mind. So please chime in with recommendations, questions, etc. You can also DM if you prefer. 

Thanks again, and I look forward to your responses!  :)"

Plenty of nomads have discussed the idea of loneliness when traveling, however after coming close to leaving the first location on my journey, I find that leaving the friends I have made here behind to travel to my next ""home"" is an even harder idea to cope with.

Loneliness can happen anywhere, however making friends and growing close to them, followed by moving far away a few months later is a unique issue to this lifestyle that is easily causing me more emotional stress than any other aspect of the lifestyle. 

Does anyone have any thoughts, comments, or ideas about this topic in general, and about how you cope with saying goodbye or see you later to friends you have met along the way? Your comments are greatly appreciated. I am loving this lifestyle so far, but this is such a bittersweet aspect of it, and I'd love to hear how other people handle it.

oiw5yu,22wq0,Is it Possible to Keep Large Screens in My Life?,"When I picture a digital nomad, it's someone typing away on a laptop in some exotic land.

I travel a lot, and have all the DN propensities. I'm xenophilic, love other languages/cultures/cuisines, and like to blend in with the local flow. I have no serious ties to USA. My work is freelance. So there's no problem making the leap.  But screens are the problem. I'm a writer, and I can't do my best work on a laptop screen.

I can make due for a few days or couple weeks, but I really don't feel comfortable writing without at least a 27"" monitor. I need to view big picture (and I know what I need; I'm a published author with a long list of credits; this isn't something I can train myself out of).

Also, my sole bourgeois indulgence is sprawling on a couch in front of a 55"" OLED to watch movies. This TV is my sole luxury item. It's not as vital as a decent-size computer monitor, but it's a big part of what I come home for. Everything else at home is negotiable. My herbs/spices/condiments and cookware are not irreplaceable. My pillow, I can bring with. Pianos are found anywhere. I like my car, but don't love it. The screens are the hangup.

At some point, we'll all fold up our screens like trousers and toss them in our suitcase. Until then, what to do?

In terms of computer monitor:

* Short-term rentals are troublesome and expensive.
* Plugging into Internet cafes with gamer screens is inconvenient.
* Buying upon arrival and trying to sell upon departure seems stressful and likely unworkable.
* Traveling with monitor would drive me nuts (I researched this pretty deeply).

In terms of Netflix (etc) on a big screen, that's not happening in the budget AirBnBs I use, and it seems daffy to upgrade just for this.

So am I stuck? There's got to be a workaround! Is there anyone out there with similar leanings who's solved it?"

Two of our dogs are medium-sized (close to 30 pounds) and one of them is a small poodle, that has only 7 pounds. Our dogs are like family to us, so giving them away to other family members is really not an option for us.

Our first dog (named Leia) is extremely smart. I love training dogs and I train her since she had only 3 months. We've already traveled with her some times. She responds extremely well to any command that I give to her, even when she is off the leash.

Our second dog (named Serena) is extremely calm. We rescued her from a junkyard, where she suffered mistreatment. She doesn't respond as well as Leia to my commands (since we've rescued her when she was already a grown-up dog) but she is really calm.

Our last dog (named Roberta) is a young and smart poodle. She is really easy to control since she is small.

After this background, here is our current scenario: we're living in a pretty big rented house, but we're both tired of our current country (we live in Brazil) and we're also tired from living here. This is already our fourth home (thinking like that, we're already nomads 🤔).

So, we're considering changing our lifestyle and start being more minimalistic, living only with the necessary. Our jobs are already full-time remote, so that should be pretty easy to achieve. For us, a dream would be living \~1y in each place, exploring and having new experiences there before moving to a different location.

My biggest fear is the following: we don't plan to have kids, but our dogs are extremely important to us. We would never give them away and we would love to have them with us. I know that would limit our options (we would not be able to move to some countries, and some hosting options would not be available to us), but I would like to know if anyone ever knew a digital nomad that lived with dogs.

I saw a couple of stories online, but every story is a nomad with only a single dog. I would like to know how crazy I am :)

Thanks for anyone reading this thread and helping me out!"
oixsgm,7c77ys4w,Having trouble finding accommodations for working,"Hey,

I work a fully remote job,  I make almost $150k.  So my job is serious and I could easily work for 10+ hours a day.  Occasionally some weekend time too.    

The issue I have is that I can’t find an apartment (airBnB) to accommodate  this.   I would like a nice, comfortable place with a view.  But the biggest issue is that I NEED a proper desk.  I take a carry on suitcase with my full set up of 2 monitors and everything. 

Does anyone else struggle with this or have recommendations?

oj7t95,10r3mc,Is this a red flag when working as freelancer?,"Hi guys, thanks for reading, this is my first post on this community although I've been lurking for a while.

I'm from Mexico and just started working for a US company as a freelancer (angular and node developer), the project is cool, the pay is good and it's fully remote (something I was looking for).

I've been working for one month and so far so good, they deposited my fist payment via payoneer. But speaking with an accountant here I found that I'm elegible for some tax benefits as an exporter of software development services, well, almost. I'm missing two requirements:

1 Receive payments via a foreign bank (payoneer transfer the money from a local bank)

2 The TaxID of the company doing the deposits.

Number 1 is not a problem, they can deposit directly to my bank account, but when I asked for the TaxID they told me that it was an unusual request and said that they didn't have that information on hand. I've waited a week and I think they don't want to share it with me.

I thought it was standard practice, I mean, doesn't the employees in the US see the company's TaxID number in their paycheck invoices? I didn't know it was some sort of secret information.

Is this a red flag? Are they probably avoiding taxes in the US and think that if they share that information it can be problematic to them? Is there any other explanation?

Also I think that I need to justify the legal origin of the money I'm receiving (which is not a small amount) I don't want the government to think I'm selling drugs or something (not far fetch given the current México-USA situation).

Thanks for your insights and advice."

I had a really great interview for a remote position with a U.S.-based company and I'm anticipating an offer. They're fairly new to remote work, but seem excited about it, and they have locations and customers in Canada and East Asia. I'm currently based in the U.S. but I've been planning on taking a gap year, mostly in Mexico. I'm trying to decide if I should take the job or decline and continue with my gap year plan.

While the job ad said the position was open to employees in the U.S., I asked in the interview if there were any remote work policies or location restrictions and they said no. I didn't explicitly ask about locations out of the country. I'd be using company-provided equipment, but they claim to not be micromanagers and I'd be roughly in the same time zone. I feel stressed out about the possibility of having to outright hide an international location as other nomads have recommended, especially as a new employee without previously established trust.

Do any of you have experience with being honest in the hiring process about your location, or have you successfully convinced or negotiated with a new employer? Any tips?

Edit to add: I'm **not** trying to hide my location, I'm looking for advice on how to proceed in the interviewing and negotiating stages to work out an honest work arrangement. "

om2wkk,,Ideas for young family that plans on being nomadic for ~6 months (Western US),"Hi all! Family of four (4 and 2 year old kids) from Northern California. Have been thinking about moving for a few years, but haven't been able to visit other cities. We aren't going to move based on Google searches...Now that we are vaccinated, and because our oldest starts kindergarten in Aug 2022, it may be an opportune time to figure this out.

Moreover, given that California schools and preschools are not going to be normal (2021-22), and preschools appear to be *less* normal that even last year, we're discussing a trip to visit other cities!

1. Cities: Any particularly great family friend cities in the Western US? We like outdoors, but also would look for good museums, a zoo, etc. City parks too. 
2. Suggestions: Anyone else with young kids that has done this? How stressful? How did you keep a general schedule? Ideas, pros/cons, etc..

We have a few cities in mind. I have a few business trips in cities that might make for good home bases for a month.

Other qualifiers:

* Walkable neighborhoods - we don't see ourselves living in typical low density suburbs, if possible 
* Schools - we'd really really like to send our children to public schools (that seems increasingly difficult in our part of California)
* Politics - not a huge issue. We'd actually prefer a place where there is a very broad-base of views, no/limited extremism. This is more a take for the long term. We'd don't want to move somewhere only to find that [math education is being gutted](https://edsource.org/2021/california-math-guidance-sparks-new-curriculum-controversy-among-parents/655272) (Also, not trying to start a political debate here!

Lastly - our bias is towards larger cities, as that may be better from a job/career point of view, and it also makes it easier to travel nationally (major airport).

Since that's for a US based and operated company (we don't do business in Europe at all, and we're a tax exempt non-profit if it matters) and I'd be in Spain for less than 183 days in each tax year, so I won't be a Spanish tax resident.

onwlsa,12nwwb,any potential issues traveling with a wirecutter to mitigate jammed luggage lock?,"I researched several different luggage locks and decided on this one:

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BDS87PQ

I received the lock and the quality is excellent.  I'm very pleased so far.  But I did read at least one Amazon review where the reviewer said they had an issue with the lock getting jammed.  Seems like this was an isolated incident and may have been due to exceptional circumstances, possibly a design flaw with a previous version or possibly even user error.  But it occurred to me that it would be helpful for me to be able to cut the lock if I needed to.  It would suck to be in a situation where I wasn't able to access my belongings in my suitcase while traveling.

So I was thinking about carrying a wire cutter in my carry on bag.  That should be sufficient for cutting through a cable luggage lock.  Here's a video of a guy easily cutting through a cable lock with a pair of sewing scissors:

https://youtu.be/K32gKwdbefg

Seems like carrying a wirecutter in a carryon bag shouldn't raise any red flags because the length of the actual blades on wirecutters is pretty short.

Special thing to note, I am an African American woman. Phenotypically I look to be East African or West Indian.

I currently work for a federal contractor in the US, which requires myself to have a US Security Clearance. (Which I currently have). I have been planning on quitting my job in about a years time, and solo traveling the world for 1-2 years, but my job offered me a promotion. I would be trained and take over as the Database Administrator for the company. Everyone on my team, including the person who I will be taking over for, currently works remote (somewhere in the US). Putting both my desires together, and I come up with being a digital nomad. 

My main question is if being a digital nomad would affect my security clearance."

Hello everyone!

I am from Canada and want to travel the world. I have Canadian and European citizenship.

I have a job that I love and that I would like to keep. I think I can convince them to work remotely 100%

op7uup,57aiodgu,How long does it take to become a Digital Nomad as a Software Developer?,"TLDR: A few years, if you work very hard. Otherwise, an indeterminate amount of time.

Wondering if the software developer career can be a viable way to achieve a sustainable DN lifestyle seems to be a popular question here. I've seen various permutations of this question being asked repeatedly. Here is my take on the topic, coming from the perspective of a senior software developer.

The first step is getting a full time position as a junior developer. This can be difficult, even with a Comp Sci degree or a bootcamp/crash course, as most job postings require some experience (classic catch 22). At least with a classic university/college degree, you can hope for a placement that may turn into a full time position. Smaller startups typically don't have the capital (money, time, man power) to allocate towards training juniors. And so, it is usually the larger companies that can take in interns and juniors.

Regardless of the size of the company, it still isn't easy. Basically, you'll need to find a company that is willing to accept a candidate that:

* Has no professional experience
* Is willing to accept a very low pay
* Is reliable
* Is loyal

By reliable, I mean someone who isn't your typical digital nomad. You should have a predictable schedule with a reliable internet connection.

By loyalty, I mean that the company would have invested a fair bit of time and money training a junior. If the junior leaves as soon as a better opportunity is available, the original company doesn't really get any return on their investment, i.e. increased productivity towards their bottom line. From what I've seen, there is little upside to hiring someone without any experience. The main upside is the company is doing a good thing for society (maybe for selfish/ulterior motives), but it comes at some expense:

* Senior developer/mentors need to spend time training, which is time not spent fixing/creating things. This can be fatiguing and can break morale for seniors. This was the case for me, working as a senior at a startup. I enjoyed mentoring juniors at first, but once they got sufficiently trained up, they'd leave for better pastures. Eventually, I couldn't mentally justify my going above and beyond, especially at the cost of my own (perceived) performance at work.
* Most contributions by juniors will by definition be lower quality, thus prolonging the code review/deployment cycle. Again, in a fast paced startup environment, it is hard to justify slow delivery. Although, larger companies can afford this.

Now, once you've managed to find a job, it's important to stick with it. You'll meet all sorts of people, some kind and gentle, others harsh and rude. You need to leave your ego at the door, and just soak in the experience and knowledge. Eventually, you will accumulate knowledge you didn't learn in university/college:

* How to deal with team members and remain happy and productive. It is easy to have misunderstandings, especially when fully remote.
* How to set expectations. Always under promise and over deliver. Never the other way around.
* How to write quality code. Receiving code reviews from experienced developers is invaluable.
* Software engineering best practices from your peers through reviewing the code of your peers.
* How to work with infrastructure and deploy/revert changes from and to staging/production.
* How to work at scale.

All this will take a few years of steady and consistent hard work. Once you have this, you have some real value, and you have leverage to negotiate. This is important. The last thing you want is to start work as a junior developer at some company, who subsequently let you go, and you're in some random country looking for a new job. If instead, you had that experience and knowledge I described above, you can confidently find a new job with ease.

So, to start off, you can try and make yourself more appealing to a potential employer by:

* Being in a stable situation with reliable connectivity: no nomading!
* Being within an acceptable overlap in terms of time zone. Don't expect an American company to hire you, if you're applying from a cafe in Istanbul.
* Demonstrating your commitment: a public Git repo with consistent commits and a portfolio of projects.
* Contributing some code to open source projects, writing blog posts on programming (your learning experiences), etc.

Finally, the two biggest things you can do to help your success:

1. Find (and keep) a good mentor. This can be a friend, or a friend of a friend, or from an online forum. Be respectful of their time, show your appreciation, work hard.
2. Be consistent with your learning. Ten minutes every day is better than 10 hours on a Sunday night."

How do you normally answer these questions?  I usually have several supplements in my suitcase which are powders enclosed in capsules.  I also have 2 supplements which are white powder, each in 1/2 ounce container.  The first time I was asked the question a couple of years ago I said ""no"" because I honestly could not think of any powders that I had in my suitcase.  But after I returned home it occurred to me that I had these items.  Since there was no impact in the past, I simply say ""no"" when asked that question now.

I had to re-check my luggage on a connecting flight through DIA airport in DC a few weeks ago and one of the agents walked their dog up to my luggage to sniff it after I took it off of the luggage carousel and there were no issues, so no concerns about false positives based on the powders  in my bag.  Do you normally take a similar practical approach when asked if you have powders in your luggage?

I think this was the first time I was asked if I had any electronics in my suitcase.  I knew that I had some electronics in my suitcase but I said no just because I wasn't expecting that to be an issue and I didn't have a backup plan.  I think the main electronics were a virtual reality headset, a hair clipper and a beard and mustache trimmer.  The beard and mustache trimmer could no longer be charged after my flight so I'm not sure if that had to do with the cabin pressure during the flight or if it was just coincidence because the trimmer was a few years old.

Are electronics or some types of electronics no longer permitted in checked luggage by some airlines?  Any idea what the general guidelines are around this and how do you accommodate?"

However the Samsonite website sizes the large Theorym @ 65 linear inches and the medium Theorym @ 58 inches.  I'm looking for an exact 62 inches for optimization - I don't want to pay extra for an oversized bag of course and I want to fully utilize my luggage space allowed by the airlines.

So do you have any recommendations on the best 62 inch checked luggage for 2021?"

I kept coming back to Spain because this country is fun and the people are good - but these last few years I've been dating someone born and raised here in Madrid who is firmly fixed here. 

I come and go for a few months at a time and no amount of playful 'bribery' changes anything. I've gladly offered to fully fund our trips anywhere - nothing too crazy necessarily, either - maybe a little holiday on a nearby island, hell, a road trip to the mountains for the weekend, anything. 

But there are always excuses. 

Our families have met and everything - this is a legit relationship spanning several years, and when I'm gone for a few months here and there we just do the long-distance thing and chat every day. 

Some people just really don't have that need to go anywhere. But I do.

How badly have I fucked up?

ot2ay7,izhiz,Buying international property along with other people (shareholders),"Hello Digital nomads,

I tend to spend at least two months in Mexico City a year escaping either the heat or the cold, I'm attracted to the diversity (many digital nomads), cultural events, food and of course the weather. So I decided to buy a condo there...

Initially I thought about buying the condo myself (300k ish), but..why taking the risk alone? If I plan to use it for 2 months a year max. So I though about buying the property using a corp with other shareholders (similar to buying shares in a corp to get a coop in the US). But none in my circle of friends were interested....

I did some research and I found a company in the US (and recently one in Mexico) that are using this model (buy properties with shareholders) but they're focusing on the beach towns, I want a condo in a cosmopolitan city where I can still work remotely.

So I had an idea, **start a business in that niche:** facilitate nomads to buy shares in remote enabled properties (good wifi, etc) in nice areas of cosmopolitan cities (Mexico City, Bogota, Barcelona, Buenos Aires etc) for a fraction of the price.

**As a digital nomads would be interested to buy shares of a property in a cosmopolitan city (Mexico City, Bogota, Barcelona etc)? let's say 50k investment for 25% ownership**

My dream would be to buy 4 properties, 25% equity each (let's say Mexico City, Madrid, Istanbul, Tokyo) and travel around the world, staying 3 months in each location. if I cannot go for whatever reason then the platform would facilitate renting the property similar to what airbnb does.

if there is no interest then I'll get a hint this is a product nobody wants.

&#x200B;

Possible questions:

why not Airbnb? I want to make it an investment, plus sometimes the airbnbs I like are not available when I need them

why not timeshares?  timeshares are not ownership per se, you still rent ""time"", and they're mostly on the beach

why not buy it yourself and rent it on airbnb? I don't want to take all the risk and I don't want the hassle of hosting"

However, I know that Bucharest and Cluj-Napoca are fairly popular destinations for digital nomads, so what do they typically do in this situation?

otwk4c,3t0e10so,"any low-skill undergrads making a significant amount of money from remote work, or is this unrealistic?","My hope / goal for these next couple years is to find a life rhythm which will balances seasonal work (July+August+September, and then Dec+jan+Feb+March) doing work like fruit picking or waitressing in ski resorts, and in my free time doing a mix of travelling and possibly earning some money with remote work and seeing just how profitable that can be. 

I say “possibly” because I find it hard to discern how realistic it would be for me to make ANY money from remote work, seeing as I’m not skilled in anything in the sense that... I have no skills backed with studies or diplomas or whatnot, and no portfolio. 

I’m lucky to be bilingual in French and English, and have a little experience tutoring kids and helping with homework, so I know this is one of the things I could focus on when looking for remote work. I also enjoy anything related to writing and am good with language, AND have a good quality mic. I have hobbies which if i invested in I could become more skilled at (like videography, video editing, and illustration). 

PS — I’ve read through several posts here along the lines of “what job can I do as a digital nomad?” and want to specify that this is not one of these posts, and I can appreciate how frustrating it must be to always have people come on here who haven’t done any research and expect the answers to be handed to them. I expect it takes motivation, effort and some ingenuity, all of which must ultimately come from yourself. Right now I’m being proactive by often reading through this sub and looking at the websites suggested which facilitate remote work, browsing the job ads and looking at freelancer’s profiles and rates for the kind of work I might be able to do, and watching a class on skilll share about Copywriting.  

My question really is — as someone who has no portfolio or strong skill set, but does have some skills which could be put to use and developed on, how realistic would it be to find remote work? Or is this kind of digital nomad lifestyle only realistically accessible to people with already-established skills, with diplomas, with a portfolio, etc. 

The idea would be to make an extra 100 - 500 / month during the periods when I am travelling and not doing seasonal work, by putting in anything from 10 to 25 hours of work / week. So I’m not trying to go full-time, let alone expecting to make MORE money than I would working any other low-skill job. 

Is there a remote work equivalent, for example, to being a supermarket assistant or waitress, which you can find paid work for even though you have little experience? What would that be, working for a call centre or something? 

Any honest answer is appreciated."

ou356h,21u6l7c5,Looking for large portable monitor for digital nomad life.,"I've been a digital nomad for about 3 years now and by far the bulkiest thing I carry around is my 2nd monitor to accompany my laptop.

I'd really like a light-weight portable monitor that is ideally \~20 inches or more. I don't care if it's a tablet or a traditional monitor, but it's got to have an adjustable stand. I can't work with a monitor that has a kickstand. Looking down is bad for the neck. I also don't want to be cheap and get something with bad response time/resolution etc etc...

Ideally I can find a large-enough, lightweight monitor with an easily detachable and foldable stand. Getting a detachable and foldable stand is rather hard...

This has to be a thing, yea? Googling only seems to lead to 15-17"" tablets with little kickstands before you get into the ""traditional"" monitor range.

Thanks!

Edit: I'd also like to add that a lot of the ""portable"" touchscreen"" monitors generally have cables sticking out the sides of them and are not at all nice to look at.

Really, this just comes down to getting a light, thin monitor with an easily detachable and foldable stand. The stand is really the biggest issue, to be honest.

UPDATE: I've decided that ""portable"" monitors all suck and don't actually get larger than 17 inches. Thus, I've decided to just carry a large monitor with me. I live and work remotely and tend to stay in locations at least 2-6 months, so I'm not actually traveling that often. and don't mind the extra size/weight. I went with this: 

[https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/msi/optix-mag274qrf-qd](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/msi/optix-mag274qrf-qd)

it's a highly rated 27 inch monitor. It weighs about 14lbs with the stand. I'll create a super cushy cardboard carrying case and put it in one of my suitcases. I've recently upgraded to carrying two suitcases, so I can afford the space/weight.  


I don't think ""portable"" monitors are where we would like them to be yet. Especially if you want something decent with a good refresh rate. They will get there, but they aren't there yet."

I got both vaccine shots in April and planning to go to Europe to visit a relative in Germany. my nationality is from a South American country that does not require VISA for the EU.  

I've been looking at the health requirements to enter the EU and getting confused with the language about only requiring the CDC vaccination card for travelers from the US. and then requiring negative PCCR tests for others. I am not sure if I can enter the EU showing my CDC card since I'm coming from the US or due to my nationality I would be required to take the PCR test too even though I've been only in the US for the last 7 months?"

But ever since the virus hit i just got demotivated and didnt do it. all the usual dn locations such as chiang mai, bali, koh pangan or mexico, which i was doing this for, are closed off or you have to drown in tests or paperwork. Also gatherings like parties /bars are shut down and beeing at a nice place alone is kinda sad. This lifestyle lives from the random connections to strangers and cool stories that arise. 

I hear a lot lately that the virus will stay, and pre 2020 travel might only be possible in 5 years or never again.

Which makes me wonder if the dn lifestyle in its current state is worth it and what someone needs to do to make it worth."

Ultimately, the DA dropped the charges and I never even had to appear in court. 

I hold a US teaching license and also taught legally in Vietnam,
I never had a problem in either country. Nonetheless, I’m still worried about this as the D7 is a whole different beast. 

My passive income totals about 1200 € per month if that matters, I plan to also work remotely but it seems like I qualify for the visa on passive income alone.

Does anyone have any experience with something like this? Should I hire a lawyer in Portugal to help me with the process?

ov7ewy,3urti,Employee Monitoring Software,"I work as a software engineer in Japan. 1 year in a startup then 5 years in a large tech company. The large tech company allowed us to work remotely since the start of the pandemic, and I finally got a taste of freedom and worked remotely from a bunch of places all around Japan, it was awesome. Few months ago they announced suddenly they were bringing everyone back to the office 5 days a week, without vaccines, no reason given. I immediately started looking for a new job. I found a fully remote job at a tech consultancy firm, and quit my old job. The new job starts on Monday. I just received the new Macbook through the post.

While setting it up, to my horror I found they had employee monitoring software installed on it 😨 One which I often see advertised on TV and train stations here, [SkySea Client View](https://www.skyseaclientview.net/telework_dm/) (you can use Google Translate to get the gist). Here's a [description of the functions](https://www.skyseaclientview.net/ver16/ver16_telework.html). Basically they can monitor when my screen is on or off, take screenshots, see all files, what I'm copying, the time I'm spending in each app. It gives me the creeps! I feel its intrusive and immoral, and shows an innate distrust of employees. And irregardless of my opinion, the fact is, it sucks a good portion of the CPU time constantly. This is micromanagement to a degree I never thought anyone would subject their employees to. I've started to wonder how long I'm gonna last at this company, but I think this software is used by increasingly more and more Japanese companies...

And the thing is, in the interview it was emphasised that ""we let our employees manage their own time"" and ""your output is what matters"".

My question is, has anyone else had such monitoring software installed on their employer-supplied PC? How did you feel about it? What should I do about it?"

Before taking the bootcamp I taught English in Taiwan for 2 years and then moved to teaching online while I traveled for a few months. I loved the ability to work and travel, but never really enjoyed teaching enough. I really loved the bootcamp though and am excited to start a new career in development. Just want to make sure I am looking ahead and taking the proper steps to become location independent within 3 years.

For now I am not thinking about starting my own company or working freelance, but who knows if that becomes a possibility down the line. Are there any recommendations for skills I should be developing or technologies I should be learning to help reach my goal of location independence? Or should my focus just be looking for companies that allow remote work? When applying/interviewing with companies, what are some signs I should be looking for or questions I should be asking about remote work?

owad95,aaxmle3s,Seeking advice for traveling with a young family,"Hi all,

Looking for some advice and tips for traveling with a young family. We are a couple in our early 30s, and looking to take 2-3 years off to travel before oldest starts school. We are planning to go with a 2.5 year old and a 6 month old, give or take a few months.
Prior to having kids, wife and I traveled a lot, and would spend 6-10 months of the year on the road, so we've already visited 50+ countries and have a good handle on traveling as adults, however have found that traveling with children is a whole different experience, so would love to hear from those who have done it before.

Now we're looking to sell all of our stuff and go on the road until it's time to settle down for schooling and some stability for our children.
We are looking for advice from folks who've traveled with kids for places to go, things to do, looking at hiring nannies/babysitters along the way, staying 1-2 months in a place to get a feel for the area, having the nanny accompany us to places, e.g. restaurants / museums to also have the benefit of someone who speaks the language.

When the oldest was 6months, we took a 4 month road trip with a camper and that turned out to be a lot of fun, trading in a lot of kids toys for a lot of cool experiences.

Our budget is up to 200k USD /year, will be fatfired at the time, and will afterwards settle down in Canada or Australia.

Looking for places that are going to be great with young kids, and easy and convenient for walking around with a stroller. Don't think we'll see many museums / art galleries except for the ones aimed at children.

Looking at basing ourselves in the following cities/countries (in no particular order) and will intermix it with trips back home and out to see friends/family, with a disclaimer that this will all depend on travel restrictions and weather:

* Japan 2 months
* Taipei, 1 month
* Seoul, 1 month
* Phuket, 1 month beach
* Iran, 1 month
* Vienna, 1month
* Amsterdam, 1month, buy some bikes and just ride around exploring playgrounds and parks
* Stockholm, 1month
* Morocco, 1month
* Boston or DC, 1month
* South Island NZ, camper 1month
* UK canal boat trip 10-14 days"

Here are the results 👇🏻,"Last year I built and launched [Roamer](https://tryroamer.com/), a chrome extension that helps people find Airbnbs in neighborhoods with fast internet. While helpful in figuring out what areas may be viable for remote working, many people told me they wouldn't be confident booking a place until they had a speed test from the listing. I set out to source speed tests from popular listings in top digital nomad destinations simply by messaging the hosts.

Surprisingly, 105 out of 207 hosts were able to respond with metrics that were useful! I've tallied a few summary stats that you may find interesting. See [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qltH846pxbTqwk2Yc7_SUivWAgzw9KBx_vhjnp4EQbI/edit?usp=sharing) for the raw data.

Since it was open in Spain I was thinking I should pay my taxes in Spain but my bank account on wise is BE- Belgium so I'm not sure should I pay taxes over there in Belgium or Spain?

As well it would be amazing if you could let me know what maximum amount of money I could receive before paying taxes, and is it included if I do transfer between my Spanish and Wise bank? Since this is a transfer between my accounts I need to know should be considered as well into taxes?

I've spent two months so far in Tbilisi and now entering my third and final. I thought I would list some of the good and bad things from my experience!

**Pros:**

* Very low cost of living, can live in luxury for ~$800 a month, live comfortably for less than that.
* Delicious food, especially the famous Georgian [Khachapuri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khachapuri)
* Genuinely kind people. Not like certain countries where they spend their tourism budget trying to convince tourists that the local people are nice, just, actually incredibly nice and helpful people, who are especially friendly to tourists.
* Very good public transit system and railway. You can get around the city (and the rest of the country if adventures into nature are desired) very cheaply.
* Cheap high-quality wine, which Georgia is famous for.
* Lots of cool leftover places from the USSR to explore, including amusement parks, old buildings, and cable cars.
* Reliable and cheap unlimited mobile data from local sim card.
* Lots of people speak a decent amount of English! English has been taught in schools for many years in Georgia, so young people typically have a good grasp of it. If you go to a store and ask if they speak english, they will either say yes or grab someone they know who does, which we always appreciate!


**Cons:**

* Internet speed is not so good. This may be the biggest hurdle for digital nomads. It varies from place to place, but my partner and I have had internet speed that only ranges from okay to bad so far.
* Difficult to find information online. You will want to use local software like maps.ge over Google maps, and auto-translate the information, because it seems much of the Georgian internet presence is available exclusively in Georgian.
* Summer months are VERY hot. We realized it would've been better to visit in the fall, when it's cool but not cold. That is what locals have also recommended us. (Fall and Spring are best, Summer is too hot, Winter is okay.)
* Pay-to-use public bathrooms. A bit odd but supposedly common in this part of the world. The cost is trivial though.

Overall we really enjoyed our time in Georgia, and I would recommend it to any nomad who isn't in constant need of high-speed internet. Next stop, Turkey!"
oxzdhw,gcxlz,I'm Done With The Nomad Scene - At Least For Now. This Is Why,"American nomad here. I became a digital nomad last year during the COVID pandemic. I'm currently in Barbados and have been working/living here under the Welcome Stamp - the remote work visa program Barbados released last year.  
 

I've been living here since October. I'm originally from the SF Bay Area. I became a DN partly because the digital nomad lifestyle makes more sense to me than any of the alternatives. I want to live a life of travel, adventure, and new experiences and choose a radically different path in life - and being a digital nomad gives me all of those things. Partly it was to escape the United States' inevitable descent into fascism and collapse. I didn't want to be stuck behind the wall with plague-ridden death closing in on all sides with the mass shooters, tiki torch nazis, and anti-masker hordes when election day rolled around. Nah. Fuck that.  
 

Living here is a dream come true. This island is a paradise. Barbados is everything I've been dreaming of for years, and more. I love my new life and can't remember a time when I've ever been this happy. My content marketing career is taking off, my business is growing, I learn new skills and discover something new every week. I end my workdays by going to the beach and having a rum punch on the way home. I've been taking scuba diving and kite surfing lessons. I have an active social and dating life and have multiple groups of friends - both Bajan (local) and in the growing DN scene in Barbados.  
 

I've tasted a life of true freedom and I don't think I can ever go back. I'm committed to this lifestyle and I intend to travel the world as a nomad and live in the most exotic locations forever. I love being a digital nomad and I have no desire to live in the US ever again.  
 

I'm just done with the dumb bullshit and petty drama I have to deal with from other nomads. I've decided to break away from the community for a while in favor of just doing my own thing, exploring Barbados on my own, and spending more time with my Bajan (colloquial name for Barbadian) friends.   
 

This is something I've been thinking about for a while, and the turning point came after an unpleasant interaction at a house party involving a dumb, r\*\*\*rd Karen at a house party with bad taste in music. I want to talk about my thought process and see if anyone has come to similar conclusions or had similar experiences.   
 

I realized something important recently. I have been experiencing Barbados through a heavily filtered lens, and that's just not why I became a nomad.   


I wanted to remove myself - both physically and culturally - as far away from my home of Silicon Valley as possible. What I crave deep down is an authentic Caribbean experience, and that's not going to be possible if I keep going to meetups, excursions, and scripted adventures that make Caribbean culture palatable to an audience of mostly white Americans. I wanna see the real shit, and I'm not gonna get that by hanging around other people like me.  
 

This happened a couple of months ago. I was invited to a lionfish hunt with a group of nomads and expats I go scuba diving with, at a popular dive shop on the south coast of the island. We set out to hunt as many lionfish as possible and grill them afterward at a BBQ house party. (For the eco-conscious, lionfish are an invasive species in Barbados that are destructive to local reefs and damage tropical ocean ecosystems in the Caribbean, so the government has given free license to hunt them and they can be killed without ethical concerns).  
 

Hell yeah, I thought. A scuba trip where I get to kill my food and eat it. These are the kinds of adventures and new experiences that drew me to the digital nomad lifestyle in the first place. The kind of thing that broadens your chest and puts hair on your balls. This is exactly what I want. Count me in.  
 

The hunt was really fun. I managed to nab a few, lionfish are easy targets because they're predators with no competing species in the Caribbean so they don't expect to be hunted.  
 

The BBQ started off fine. I offered to bring a Bluetooth speaker and put on some music. I'd scarfed down a few lionfish sandwiches at this point and chug a few glasses of rum, and at this point, I was pretty buzzed.  
 

So, what do I play? Well, the music of the Caribbean is dancehall and soca. I'm learning to like soca and I fuck HEAVY with dancehall. Rolling down the street playing bashment tunes out my window with the bass turned all the way up. Big booty dancehall queens doing the splits and bouncing on the floor. Fuck yeah dude, I LOVE that shit.  
 

But my taste in dancehall isn't everyone's cup of tea. I'm into a lot of wacky stuff like Red Rat, Buccaneer, and Goofy - which for reference is like listening to hip-hop and being really into Sir Mix-a-Lot, Flava Flav, or Biz Markie - music that's a lot of fun but a little dated and that no one takes seriously anymore.   
 

I thought about playing some stuff like Bounty Killer, Ward 21, Mr. Lexxus, or Baby Cham - the cultural equivalent of playing something like Tupac or Biggie Smalls or Wu-Tang Clan. It's great music but it's more thug shit - not appropriate for a house party.  
 

Then another thought occurs. Maybe I should play Jamaican oldies and classics. Augustus Pablo. Toots and the Maytals. Desmond Dekker. Prince Buster. In the Caribbean, that's music that older generations listen to - like Frank Sinatra or Elvis or Fats Waller back in the States. Yeah, I could educate the rest of these whitey, colonizer dum-dums (this is a facetious statement - I'm whiter than a Republican with a bukkake fetish) about OG Jamaican music, what could possibly go wrong with that? (Insert heavy sarcasm here)  
 

So I do that and see what people's reactions are. A few people are into it. It's not everyone's cup of tea but most people don't mind.  
 

That is, until the dumb, stupid, r\*\*\*rd Karen across the table from me grimaces and goes ""No. What is this smooth jazz bullshit. We need to play island vibes.""  
 

So I'm like, fine whatever. I hand the speaker over to her.  
 

And what does she play? Weak, watered-down dancehall for diaper-poop weenies. Sean Paul. Alkaline. Popcaan. Stuff like that. Because apparently, *that's* island vibes.  🙄  
 

It's hard for me to understate my emotional reaction to this situation. I didn't just dislike her taste in music. I was *disgusted* by it. I felt like throwing up in my mouth.  
 

I wanted to reach across the table and dick-smack her into silence. Or pour beer on her. Or push her off of a roof. Or drag my balls across her face and make her wear my balls on her eyes like a pair of scrotum goggles for being such a dumb r\*\*\*rd Karen*.* Or for her to get trampled by a horse. Or have her next family Christmas be ruined. Or for her to get audited by the IRS. (I know this is pretty misogynistic language. I'm trying to give an honest account of what was going through my head).  
 

But instead, I did what I thought was the responsible thing and removed myself from the situation before my rum-soaked brain could act on any of its uglier impulses and do/say something rude, crass, aggressive, or sexually charged at her that would result in me a) getting kneed in the balls, b) banned from all future dives at the organizing dive shop, or c) possibly get arrested/slapped with a restraining order. I went to the other side of the party and started chatting with people I vibed with more. I ended up having a great time anyway, but the whole thing still put a bad taste in my mouth.  
 

Now, you're probably reading this thinking ""Wow dude, wtf is wrong with you/Why don't you just mellow the f\*\*k out/You need help/It's just music/What's your f\*\*\*ing problem?""  
 

And you wouldn't be wrong to think this. I know this is a really stupid thing to be hung up over, and that I should probably get over it. And I will. Eventually. And I know that this situation is probably more reflective of me than it is of her. I get so obsessed with niche genres of music that it makes it difficult for me to relate to healthy, normal, well-adjusted people who usually like objectively awful corporate Top 40 garbage.  
 

It might help if I put this situation into a little context so you can understand why this bothered me so much.   
 

Imagine the following scenario. You are at a party. You put on some music - something timeless, classic, and universally liked that cool, smart people who understand what good music is all agree is good music. Something like, I dunno, Talking Heads, Kraftwerk, Miles Davis, Cab Calloway, Django Reinhardt. You can think of Augustus Pablo like the Miles Davis of Jamaica. There are wall murals of him on Orange Street in downtown Kingston.  
 

And then along comes this little Gen Z'er shitstain who goes ""ew, gross, old people music."" And then proceeds to put on LMFAO. Or that Gucci Gang song. Or Chainsmokers. Or Billie Eilish. Or Blink-182. Or some other bland, trendy, obnoxious garbage that no one with any culture or class would ever listen to and would only ever unironically like if they were a) a hipster, b) a douchebag, or c) a twat.   


That, for me, would normally be enough to instantly dislike someone without knowing anything else about them. But even apart from that, I remember always having a bad feeling about this person - she's one of only a handful of dive instructors at the shop where I got PADI certified and we'd been diving together pretty often up until this point. She's trashy, shallow, abrasive, fake, obnoxious, and not even particularly nice. She gets invited to a lot of nomad/expat parties and for the life of me, I have no idea why.  
 

But it turns out, as much as I think this person sucks, I'm actually grateful for this experience because it made me realize something important. By hanging out and partying with people from my same cultural background, I've been missing out on more authentic experiences - and the ones that I *have* been getting have still been crafted to reflect my own history and cultural background as a white American. My Bajan friends and my own solo adventures wandering around the Barbadian countryside and chatting with people in rum shops have been giving me a taste of the real stuff, and *that's* what I want more of.  
 

Please don't read this and think that I haven't been enjoying my time in Barbados. It's much the opposite. I love this little island. Really and truly I do. I love Barbados with all of my heart, body, mind and soul. This country and this government made my heart's deepest desires possible when I thought the pandemic and my own country's cruelty and incompetence had killed it, possibly forever. 

&#x200B;

Barbados is the only place where I have ever been genuinely happy for this length of time. The last time I felt so utterly complete and at peace with myself was when I went to Jamaica four years ago - and I was only there for about a week.  
 

I want to see it. Know it. Experience it. Feel it. *Understand it*. And I don't think that's possible if I keep hanging out with other nomads. I know that probably sounds weird.  
 

I think I've been ready to make this decision for a while. This wasn't the only incident that put me off from the nomad scene. Meetups at hotels, resorts, and overpriced restaurants. Watching stupid, high-school-level drama go down on the local WhatsApp nomad chats. It's fun for a while and it's a good way to meet people going through the same thing you are, but it quickly gets old and tired. I dunno man, I'm just sick of it.  
 

I've had a lot of time to think since the house party I talked about, about who we are and what I'm doing here.

&#x200B;

Here you have this group of millennials, mostly tech workers, who move into one country and out of another like hermit crabs and turn developing countries into their own personal playgrounds. They become isolated within their own little worlds of privilege and comfort and rarely if ever make any genuine effort to integrate into their host cultures or contributing to the local economy.

&#x200B;

It's pretty messed up when you start to think about it. I guess I can't claim to be any different.  
 

But Barbados isn't my fantasy adventure island where all of my dreams magically come true. This is a real place. A developing country with real developing country problems. The island has a record 40% unemployment rate because of the very real, and very much still ongoing global pandemic and resulting mass human die-off, political upheaval, and societal breakdown that I and my fellow Welcome Stampers came to Barbados to get away from.  
 

That isn't to say that there aren't cool, genuine people in the digital nomad community both here in Barbados and elsewhere. I've found mentors and made friendships in the DN scene here that I place a very high value on.   
 

But I didn't spend the last four years reinventing my life and then pack it into a suitcase and move it 4,000 miles away just to get absorbed into another tech worker bubble. I get enough of that at home. That's all I'm saying.  
 

Nomads of Reddit, AITA for being a music snob, or did I realize something important about the expectations vs. reality of the digital nomad lifestyle? Maybe a little of both?"
oy2l89,uc2a5n0,Digital Nomad in Mexico,"Hello everyone, does anyone have experience with applying for a Temporary Residency Permit in Mexico while also working remotely?

I just had a call with an immigration lawyer and they suggested 2 options to me.

1) Standard Tourist/Visitors visa and work remotely which they said isn’t permitted under this visa.

2) Temporary Work Permit and work remotely which also isn’t permitted under this visa.

I currently have an appointment with the embassy in my country to apply for the Temporary Residency visa but I was told not to mention the working remotely thing.

Can anyone shed their insights/experiences? Beyond comments like “it doesn’t say you can’t”"

Since you guys were such a help the other day, I have a follow up.

The company is giving me the option to sign the contract as an individual or as (the Ontario equivalent of) a LLC. Which is better and why? 

As a consultant with a day rate, do I need to charge tax on top of that rate for my invoicing, or would my income tax deductions be used instead?

oym6p2,557sw97k,My US-based company has offices in Europe- how should I approach a transfer?,"I have dual USA/EU citizenship and have been working for my US-based company for 5+ years. My company has been fully WFH since March 2020, and I was recently offered and accepted the opportunity to be remote full-time. 

There hasn’t been any discussion around whether remote work can only be within the US, but I’d like to make a case for working remotely from Europe for a year or two while keeping my same job. The company has existing offices and employees in 5+ EU countries. I figure I could work out of these offices if needed, or be assigned to one of the offices but work remotely (which is what I am currently doing in the US). Ideally, I’d like to travel between cities every 2-3 months and am fine with continuing to work EST.

I’ve been reading a lot on this subreddit about tax implications/residency issues/etc., but given my citizenship and my company’s international presence, I feel like I’m in a pretty fortunate position where this could actually work out. I want to bring this proposal to my boss but want to make sure I’m thinking through everything and making it as easy for him/my company so that I’m more likely to get the green light.

Are there any other complexities I should be considering? Does anyone have advice based on prior experience with this type of conversation? Appreciate any insight."

I asked my currently employer about being remote as we spent March 2020-January 2021 completely remote, but they feel it’s important we be at least nearby to come in as needed. I’m finding the same thing with other positions. They’re “remote” but you need to come in as needed. Not really what I’m looking for. Only things I’ve really seen that are possible are 6 months-1 year contract work, but I’d rather not be without job security like that. Overall I’m just not very happy.

oyvktf,gijexhh,Throwing a bone to the wannabe DN's on this sub -- My DN friendly company is looking to hire for a Jr. sales position.,"Not sure if job postings are allowed on here but wanted to give it a try. I'm head of sales for a small US based media company that's looking to hire it's first BDR (Business Development Representative). We're completely remote - since starting I've personally worked out of Oceania, LATAM and Europe.

It's an entry level role and would suit someone who's early in their career and interested in sales/biz dev. The company itself sells audience development products to podcasts and newsletter, so an interest in media or marketing will be valuable as well.

We're more interested in the right person than experience, but previous sales/lead generation experience is a plus.

Must be a US citizen. You'll be paid as a contractor on a base wage of $4k/month + quarterly bonus. If you're interested PM away!  
Update: I didn't expect to get even half the amount of interest I've gotten from this. If you've PM'd please be patient while I work my way through my inbox. Thanks for your interest!"
