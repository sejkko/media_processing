oz8wqz,1jk3rhmy,Good work locations by the beach in October/November?,"I'm looking to spend about a month working remotely in October/November and would like to be in a place that meets the following criteria:

\- Vibrant nightlife and easy to meet new people

\- As close to EST time zone as possible

\- Natural beauty/ places to explore on off days

ozd8p0,taigr,The Cheapest & Best All-Around Phone Plan in The US,"I lived in Europe for about 10 years and I'm now in the US. In Europe, you can get a phone plan that includes unlimited calls and texts and a decent amount of mobile data for around $10 a month. In the US I've seen plans starting at $100 a month and so many other wacky options. What phone plan do you recommend that provides good coverage all around the US, is pay as you go, or has no penalties for canceling or switching to another phone provider? I don't need a ton of data as I only watch videos on wifi at home, so I mainly use data when traveling for GPS, sending messages, doing voice calls, or looking something up on the internet. It'd be nice to have the option to upgrade for more data when necessary. The main thing is I don't want to be locked into a contract with ridiculous fees. I'll be using my own phone, so I don't need a plan that includes a new phone."
ozgr3r,3qqot61n,How do you guys deal with Booking. Com hosts who make threats like call the police or use force if you do not agree with their charges?,"Hi,

I am a digital nomad living in Mexico. Digital nomads should know the following if they are using Booking. Booking. com does not deal with disputes between hosts and guests. All matters have to be dealt with host and guests. So if a host charges you for damages and you do not agree with the charge, Booking does not help.

I had a dispute with the Booking.com host in Mexico where I damaged something and he asked me to pay for the entire thing . I talked the locals and they told me his price is too high. The locals told me a range for what I should be paying. Even my friend told me it is too high. So basically he is ripping me off as he will buy a used one or get a cheap one and a make difference of the profits.  So he is trying to make money of this charge.

Unfortunately I could not find a replacement for thing. So I told him that his price is too high and offered a price that I am willing to pay. But he refused and I refused his price.  So he filed the compliant to booking.  Then he told me if I do not pay before I leave, he told me he will call the police. I messaged Booking and Booking just told me that they cannot do anything and you have to pay him what his price is.  So out of panic of him calling police, I paid him. 

My question: What if a booking. com host makes threats like police or use force to pay you for charges you do not agree with? Thank you so much."

p00uqz,qq2e6,Advice on creating a small co-working/private office for rent for nomads,"Hello nomads!

I'll start by thanking you for your time reading this and wishing you all happy and fulfilling nomad experiences  :)

I wanted to get the advice or feedback from seasoned nomads with regards to creating a small rentable office space for digital nomads in my hometown.

As a quick background my wife and I enjoyed our short stint travelling and working as digital nomads in Europe throughout 2019. It was a way for us to try living in different towns around europe, to see which one we would prefer moving to on a more permanent basis. We've since settled down a bit although my travelling sences are starting to tingle again whenever I feel i'm growing roots in a place...I'm sure i'm not alone in this feeling on this sub.

Anyway to get to the point of this post, my wife and I inherited a very small (10m2) room in the centre of our hometown, and I was thinking into making it into a digital nomad productivity haven as it were. A small private office space that can be rented out without too much of a fuss on a day to day basis by anyone looking to work in a space with a comfortable office chair, a good coffee machine a nice desk with big monitors in the center of the city. 

I say it's co-working space but because of the size it really would be a private office for perhaps 2 people.

I know during our nomad days I had the occasional need to go to a professional place to work in, especially on travelling days when we needed to change airbnbs and cities and I wasn't always feeling at ease with going to a co-working space or cafe, especially a big one where i wasn't going to be sure if i get the adequate working space and silence to focus on what needed to be done.

I just wanted to get you guys and gals input on whether an ad-hoc self check-in type private comfy office would be something others are interested in as well or whether larger co-working spaces, hotel rooms, cafes are more interesting.

What do you guys miss during your trips that such a digital nomad nook can offer?

Thank you very much for your input :) happy travels"

p0da7u,3nb7lkjm,Digital Nomad in Hawaii?,"I am looking to do a 2-4 week stay as a digital nomad in late November into December. I am heavily thinking about Hawaii.

From what I am seeing on Airbnb I could get a much nicer spot on the big island.

p0l8id,kvcib,VoIP service for home country number while aboard,"I'm going to be in Russian for 2 years, and was planning on porting my Canadian phone number to a VoIP service (specifically [voip.ms](https://voip.ms)) while in Russia.  Idea being that I would get a Russian SIM (and number) and that would be my primary phone number, but then use a soft-phone to still receive calls/text to my Canadian number.  Motivation for this is to...

* Receive SMS for two-factor-auth for a bunch of services (e.g. banking, google accounts, etc)
* Keep my Canadian number so I can use it when I return
* Occasional might have old contact reach out by SMS/voice

However, I spoke with a [voip.ms](https://voip.ms) agent and they said that ""SMS messages from Short Code numbers, may not work"", which is a problem for the first point (most important to me) since most 2FA SMS's seem to come from [Short Code numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_code#Canada).

So questions are...

1. **Any one have experience with** [**voip.ms**](https://voip.ms) **and receiving 2FA SMS messages?**  I'm wondering if it is an problem were it works 99% of the time, but not 100% so they just have to say ""it may not work"". I.e. it isn't perfect but I can live with it.  Perhaps a risky gamble, but I'm happy for any input.
2. **Anyone aware of a VoIP provider that does promise delivery from short code numbers?**
3. **Anyone suffered through restoring access to accounts after losing access to old mobile number?** I'm guessing a few people have given up an old number, and forgotten about an account that used 2FA.  Of course, the answer will be different depending on the service, but I'm just hoping to see if it was closer to....

* Impossible, I lost access to my account
* Not too bad, the process to restore access wasn't too bad.

And **any advice in general about how best to maintain/manage your home country phone number would be greatly appreciated**.  In my case I'm interested in services that work with Canadian numbers, but feel free to answer for other countries if you have advice there (other readers may benefit).

Thanks in advance for any advice and happy trails all.

EDIT: This post isn't really getting too much traction, but thanks to all who replied.  I learned a little bit more outside the thread, so share that and my plan.  

* **User of** [**voip.ms**](https://voip.ms) **said that the Short Code thing was more of a problem in the US  and seemed to ""mostly work"" in Canada**.  Kinda squishy advice, but they work for Google on the Voice team, and gave me enough warm-fuzzies to convince me to take a chance on it.  
   * Although I'm going to keep my Canadian account (FIDO) for a month after I move to Russia, so that I can get 2FA messages when I first start logging in from Russian IPs.  Then I'll port my number over to [voip.ms](https://voip.ms).  
* **People change phone numbers and lose access to there old numbers.... so most services most have a way to deal with this, right?!**  I figure if I at least check the process for my most important accounts, if there are any I miss I should be able to muddle through some recovery process.
   * I strongly recommend folks take some time to do their homework before trying this, because I could see it being a big pain-in-the-ass (and perhaps impossible in some cases) to restore access to accounts e.g. [this google support thread](https://support.google.com/accounts/thread/8673989/no-access-to-old-phone-number-for-2-step-verification?hl=en).  And in the previous version of my edit, I mentioned this: e.g. CIBC will only send 2FA messages to a [limited number of country codes](https://cibc.intelliresponse.com/public/en/index.jsp?requestType=NormalRequest&interfaceID=8&id=-1&source=1&question=Can%20I%20receive%20a%20verification%20code%20if%20I%20have%20an%20international%20phone%20number?) (not including Russia).  So just biting bullet and updating all accounts, won't even work in all cases.
* **VoIP services are the only real low-cost way to hang on to your number for years at a time (for a Canadian number).**
   * DISCLAIMER: I did not exhaustively research options, so total possible I have missed something
   * In the past carriers offered proper pay as you go options, where there was a a nominal monthly fee (e.g. for 911) but not more than a couple bucks.  This no longer seems to be the case, and you have to have a monthly plan (even if it is pre-paid and contract-less).  At the time of writing the typical rate for the most basic plan was about $15 CAD.
   * One possible exception: SpeakOut ([looks like $25 CAD lasts for a year](https://www.speakout7eleven.ca/why-choose-speakout))

Thanks to all who provided some advice, and sorry for the long thread, but hopeful parts of it might help some folks out there in the future. 

P.S. If I make my move and decide my advice above was wrong, I'll update this post... assuming I'm not locked out of all my accounts :)"

I was just curious about what people here use.

Here are some pros and cons of both I have listed so far:

&#x200B;

Laptop:

Pros:  

\-Easier to carry -Has battery (No need for an outlet) -Quick and simple to use -Already comes with full functionality (wireless connection, speakers...) -Much more space efficient.

Cons:

\-You can get PCs with much better specs for the same price -overheating -impossible to upgrade (most will only allow you to upgrade RAM)  -Pain in the ass to troubleshoot and fix -Something broke and now you need to replace a part? good luck finding a replacement kiddo.  


Portable PCs:

Pros:

\-More powerful -Upgradeable -Easily fixable -You can customize it to your needs.

Cons:

\-Much less space efficient (You can just throw your laptop into your backpack while you'll need a full hand case just for your PC). -You have to go through the trouble of actually engineering it. -You have to make sure to fit all the functionality of a PC in the smallest space possble (speakers, wifi... when space becomes a problem this is much harder than it sounds.) -Needs an outlet or sometimes even more. -No battery, unless you want to go through the trouble of adding a battery too.

But here's the catch, I don't want to be living and traveling at the same time. I've been backpacking every single summer since when I was 18, pretty much everywhere in Europe but Scandinavia. I'd like to stay somewhere for a longer period of time, like 6 months say, make friends, experience the city as a local and repeat, up until I maybe find the place/the people I want to settle in/with.

I seem to understand (but correct me if I'm wrong) that most people in this sub move much more frequently than that, making the experience quite different from a lot of point of views.

\- Save some money (for rare occasions). This doesn't have to me $5000 of whatever. Just a little for unexpected stuff.

\- Use [nomadlist.com](https://nomadlist.com) \-> this startup from Pieter Levels helped me a lot on managing the next destinations and to get balance between income & expenses.

\- Book your flight! Do not say ""one day"", but just book the flight and do it. Getting out of the comfort zone has been the most valuable to me so far!

\- Get yourself remote opportunities. Really. This was most important to me. I don't have a fulltime job, but most important is that it's remote. Be creative and apply for a lot of remote jobs. Remote jobs are not only for those who are coders or designers.

I'm in the process of securing an online job and my partner is looking at the option of proof of funds. Been looking at all the digital nomad visa's and we keep coming across barriers. Can't apply to any visa's yet as of course my passport is going to expire in March so need to get a new one to apply to any digital nomad visa's. Looks like the Croatia one is the easiest as we can just apply online? Just wondering processing times, from what I can see it looks like 4 weeks at the longest? Just wanting to see if people are still getting approved for this visa, couldn't find much online as it appears to be fairly new. Also when people applied did you upload rental for 6months? What is the monthly income required? Can you also submit proof of funds instead for 6 months (and then renew the visa for another 6 or does it need to be a year)?  Cheers!"

We are experienced travelers and have been on the road for 1 year+. Looking for a recommendation!

Things we prioritize:
- Good nature (mountain hikes - the harder the better; not talking about public parks here) We love the outdoors 
- Good inner city Public transit (we will not have a car)
- Good connectivity to rest of Europe for weekend trips (Low cost airlines or train)
- Accessible half day trips (hiking or sightseeing) without a car (we work US hours so 3-11pm European time and will wake up at 8am to crush a 7-8miler or visit a small town nearby before work)
- Great food scene (local and international)
- Rich history (museums or other forms)
- Vibrant art scene (not an artist by any imagination but we do fuck with the bohemian style and street art grafitti)

Wants but not needs: 
- Diversity (we are both minorities)
- Cost (doesn’t have to be super cheap but budgeting about $1500 USD per month for accommodation)

We looked into Austria but Vienna seemed like the nature was a bit far and Salzburg or Innsbruck seems to fit our wants better. But thinking 1 month there might be too long? 

Also considered Rome as we love Italian food and the rich history is intriguing but we can’t find any decent Airbnbs after fees and tourist tax for less than $1500."

2. For editing, are there any decent courses out there under 100-150 euro?

At hotels, you earn points with your hotel credit cards, get room upgrades based on your status and free breakfast. Most extended stay hotel chains also have full kitchen so you can cook

p4t3a0,13fury,Partner and I are thinking about working remotely and traveling abroad for about a year. Is our plan possible?,"My partner and I currently live, and are citizens of, the United States. Both of us have been to Europe before, myself for a brief vacation, her while studying abroad while at university. We’d both very much like to go back. 

With Covid-19 our jobs have evolved such that we can and do work remotely full-time, but we still reside in the state where we’re employed. With this newfound freedom we thought it might be a good time to try an extended “workcation” in Europe where we perform our normal U.S. jobs while in another country. Our thoughts were stay in the Schengen countries for no more than 90 days, then a non-Schengen country for 90 days, back to the Schengen countries for no more than 90 days, back to the non-Schengen countries for less than 90 days, then go back to the U.S. All while working our normal 8 hour jobs for our companies back home. 

While we may not want to do a whole year this would still be a significant part of the year. Our primary concern is if this is legal? As we’ve looked into it we keep seeing vague and/or conflicting information on whether this is possible. Taxes are one concern, but we have every intention of returning to our state of residence when we’re done traveling. Also, it seems this may not be allowed in the European countries without a work visa, but we’ve seen online that it’s actually okay since our jobs and paychecks remain in the U.S. 

If there’s anyone that can provide us with some insight it would be greatly appreciated! We’d really like to do this and would like to do this and keep our jobs!"

I'm currently an SEO Outreach Exec and I wondered if it's possible to work for a company in a part time role remotely. It would be amazing if I could find a UK company as I have a huge database of UK blogs and sites that I could utilise, however there would obviously be the issue of the time difference.

I wondered if anyone's had experience with working for a business and logging hours and then occasionally having  virtual meetings to discuss the strategy, progress, results etc. Or is this just a fairytale?

Freelance work on sites such as Upwork and Freelancer seems the more usual 'go to places' for someone in my position, but as a newb I just worry about getting the regular work, building a portfolio and the tax implications that comes with it which is why working for a company on a part time basis seems more secure (for example applying via indeed and other job sites etc.)

Reading this back perhaps I just need to dive in head first with the freelancing, build up a portfolio and clue up on things like tax HOWEVER it would be great to hear from anyone who has been employed by a company on a part time basis while travelling.

I usually ignore data breaches because it seems like every major company has or will be hacked but this one is pretty bad. Make sure you all change your pins or passwords as needed. Everyone just assumes it won't happen to them but having your identity stolen or digital accounts and credit cards shut down while living and working abroad would not be a great situation to be in.

[https://www.wired.com/story/t-mobile-hack-data-phishing/](https://www.wired.com/story/t-mobile-hack-data-phishing/)

Problem:

>Hackers claim to have obtained the data of 100 million people—including sensitive personal information.  
>  
>A lot of the T-Mobile data is out there already in various forms across various breaches. But having it centralized streamlines the process for criminals—or for someone with a grudge, or a specific high-value victim in mind, says Abigail Showman, team lead at risk intelligence firm Flashpoint.  
>  
>And while names and addresses may be fairly common grist at this point, International Mobile Equipment Identity numbers are not. Because each IMEI number is tied to a specific customer’s phone, knowing it could help in a so-called SIM-swap attack. “This could lead to account takeover concerns,” Showman says, “since **threat actors could gain access to two-factor authentication or one-time passwords tied to other accounts**—such as email, banking, or any other account employing advanced authentication security feature—using a victim’s phone number.”  
>  
>That’s not a hypothetical concern; SIM-swap attacks have run rampant over the past several years, and a previous breach, which T-Mobile disclosed [in February](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/t-mobile-discloses-data-breach-after-sim-swapping-attacks/), was used specifically to execute them.

&#x200B;

Recommended Solutions:

>Change your T-Mobile password and security PIN. Companies that have leaked social security numbers and other especially sensitive information have in the past offered free credit monitoring to victims, so keep an eye on communications from T-Mobile to see if it offers the same. As for [stopping SIM-swap attacks](https://www.wired.com/story/sim-swap-attack-defend-phone/), there’s not much you can do against a determined attacker, but a good first step is to start using [app-based authentication](https://www.wired.com/story/two-factor-authentication-apps-authy-google-authenticator/) instead of having codes sent to you by text message.

I sit and think about how life could be so different with just one decision.

I had a friend who took a random solo trip to Poland and met the love of her life on bumble. She then moved there to be with him.

I want to put my stuff in storage, say FU to my apartment complex that has been trying to bleed me dry, and go somewhere! Spain, or france, or somewhere in asia for a month, hop around. Maybe find a central place and be able to take trains and cheap flights everywhere else. I'd love to be able to write and self publish books for that little extra income.

But I'm also so scared. Hopping out of the comfort zone is so scary. At least every day I can hop in my car and go home and have my bed.

I get scared of running out of money, getting stranded, being unsafe, not making friends,racism as a black woman.

These are just my thoughts.

I'd love to hear how you all got started."

I'm being taught almost everything, but personally, I kinda hate hardcore programming, like data structures, complex algorithms, and stuff. I've started web development recently and I'd say I can sustain that skill because it requires less stuff with mathematical logic. I'd say my biggest flaw is that I start doing new skills only to abandon them midway without perfecting them. 

I'm looking for that one field/skill which once I specialize/perfect, could land me a digital nomad job. Also, I want some suggestions on how to start the journey. I am very interested in photography and even have an Instagram page but I won't consider myself as an intermediate, else if possible I'd like to consider that as a source of passive income in the future, not more. 

Also, I love traveling since I was a kid and I wanna seriously prove myself and do something in this field. At the end of the day, it makes me happy and that's all I want.

Would prefer a more temperate climate, but I'm from Canada and don't mind the occasional cold. One thing I want though is lots of greenery and old forested areas.

As a Canadian, Vancouver Island is a clear possibility, but unfortunately even in the small towns up north the cost of living is crazy. I have UK citizenship, but there didn't seem to be anywhere with thick forests like I'm used to. Maybe Edinburgh? 

Also, bonus points if the place has a good literary scene. I read maybe 50 books a year and love discussing stuff, so having a good library/good English bookstore would be nice.

One place that looked nice was the Azores, with average yearly temperatures seeming to range between 12-26 C. But I've never been there before, and I have no idea what the situation is like"

p7nt3u,6gv96809,Does Remote Work Actually Help Fight Climate Change?,"﻿﻿Humans are accelerating climate change, there is no doubt about that. Remote work was once seen as a great way to cut carbon emissions by taking cars off the road. However, remote working is causing increases in emissions in other areas.

Research has shown the various ways that remote work is good for the environment and also bad. Some of the startling findings include:

&#x200B;

* ﻿﻿Where you get your electricity from plays a huge role in your carbon footprint
* Increased flights for company meetups can offset the carbon saving from not commuting
* Hybrid work is the least environmentally friendly option
* Seasonality plays a huge role in energy consumption

Looking forward, I’m thinking about relocating to central or South America for a while. I just spent three weeks in Costa Rica and it reignited my interest in learning Spanish (I suppose I’m an intermediate level - I can get around and hold casual conversations). I liked San Jose but I didn’t get to spend all that much time there, and I have been to Mexico City and liked parts of it. It’s awfully big, though, as I’m from a city with a population of under one million. I really value being able to get out of the house and easily explore when Im not working, since my remote job depends on me talking on the phone all day and I’ll probably have to do that from inside my home.

It would be wonderful to have him with me, but I am worried that if I travel away from him too much, he will be unhappy. How's cat-sitting in Thailand? Is it expensive? Is it easy to get? Do you have a cat and do you travel a lot?

I am currently in the process of signing a new job contract which allows me to work from anywhere in the EU. I wanted to get an idea of cities where I could move to, here are some of the things I would be looking for from the job perspective as well as my personal life:

1. High speed internet. Most of my job is with a computer and video calling and being online. So high speed unlimited internet, whether through wifi or cellular is absolutely important for me. I currently have a 100 mbits wifi connection and this suits me perfectly.
2. I do not have my contract yet but I think I will be earning around €2400-€2600 per month after taxes. So a city where this salary would be enough to rent a studio apartment or something around 50 sq m along with the other daily requirements would be great.
3. I like to go out for a run every now and then, so a city where it is possible to go out and just jog in a park or on the sidewalks would also be great. If not somewhere I can sign up for a decent priced gym would also be okay.
4. I am brown and while most of Europe has been very welcoming, I would still like to move to a place where it is ok for someone brown to move to.
5. I speak fluent English and decent German among all the European languages. I am open to learning other languages of course.
6. It would be nice if I could have access to a moderately large airport close by but this is not a requirement.
7. I come from a country with warmer climate, so it would be nice if the temperatures are not too low. Also I personally love the beach, so it would be nice if it could be a beach town.

Kindly let me know if I can provide any further information and I will edit the post to add these."

&#x200B;

I am an italian technical writer that has been living in Poland, mostly Krakow, for the past 5 years. I have loved the country and its people but I am kind of a restless person and in the last 2 years I have been growing tired of it. I have seen most everywhere (all the major cities, all the main national parks but Bialowieza, plenty of castles and hiked in the mountains), and am thinking of changing to a long-term destination where I can build a family and use as a base for further traveling in the years to come.

What I would like to have:

&#x200B;

* A warm climate. Snow is nice and I don't mind spending evenings in while outside it is raining but after experiencing 14 days of cloudy/rainy in July this year in Krakow I need a place that has a proper, 3-4 months long, summer.
* Sea. I miss the sea the most. A warm one would be ideal but I would accept a cold one.
* Me and my gf don't earn that much to afford big EU cities yet so a place with reasonable renting costs is a requirement. 5-600€/month looks ok, we can raise it to 800€ if the place is otherwise perfect for us but not more than that.
* A city. I have been living in big cities all my life and can easily get bored of small towns. Not a fan of the metropolis vibe but a city that has 500k-2mil inhabitants sounds like the right amount.
* as I would like to raise a family, safety and good access to culture are a priority.
* I don't drive nor I plan to do it (my gf does though), so a place that is pedestrian-friendly is important. I plan to move through public transportation so anywhere where I don't have to wait 50 mins for a bus would do.
* I don't mind learning new languages. I speak native italian, fluent english, intermediate spanish and basic portuguese and polish. Places where I can get by with these languages would held an advantage.
* I am an EU citizen as my gf and would highly prefer to stay within EU, or a country that has low work visa requirements for people like us.

Any place that fits all the requirements? Well, most of them is more probable. Thanks in advance."

p9w01z,6xqrx4fn,Monitor for a travelling person? Something that has a quick-release stand,"Hello. I'm needing a new monitor since my current one needs to be unscrewed and it is a hassle to do it every time I relocate.

  
Something like quick release, I don't know. Something that doesn't need to be unscrewed, or doesn't need tools to detach such that it can quickly be transported via a luggage with clothes.

Budget <$300, preferable a model/brand that is widely available.  
Screen size: 15.6"" to 24""  
Mac compatible

It doesn't have to be very high quality, but good/decent quality.

Also, is the Asus Zenscreen MB16AP good for this purpose or is it too pricey?

Most of our company's tech teams are already distributed across the USA based on department, so if this goes well I could make a case for my boss to let my team move around instead of us staying on our HQ in the East Coast.

My only employer restriction is it has to legally be part of the United States of America due to data privacy laws.

Plan is to work as normal Monday through Fridays then relax and explore the new area on the weekends and evenings. Main things I'm looking for are a fast internet, walkeability (I hate parking), and warm weather in winter.

Rent and living expenses everywhere else in the USA is lower than my current city, so cost is not a major factor. I also effectively lived out of a suitcase the last 7 years so small spaces are fine.

paihvg,e3we3bax,Working for an Australian company from Japan,"Hello, I wanted to present a little plan I have to get some feedbacks on doability. I'm a european software engineer and I would like to spend at least one year abroad next year. I'm hoping that things will open up by then, but I can change my destination depending on what country makes it easier.

One of the countries I'd like to spend the most time in is Japan (with a work holiday visa), as I'd like to learn japanese fluently. But because of my modest level in japanese at this point, and also the work conditions, I'd rather not work for a japanese company. I will take a look at foreign companies in Japan but I guess the options there might be limited.

So I was wondering if it would be a good idea to first go to Australia (or NZ) for some time (could end up being a whole year too), find a job in software there, either remote-friendly from the start or first work from there and then ask for full-remote. The idea is to have a job in english on a timezone close to Japan and eastern Asia. I could go to Australia with another WHV or maybe with a touristic visa and take some freelancing clients ? Don't know if this last option is possible at all. I currently work as a freelancer here in Paris.

Overall, is this a common strategy or are there issues I didn't think of ?

pamoem,5tkpd,US remote worker looking for an non-US company to work for,"I want to live and work abroad, but my spouse does not. One compromise we’ve figured out is permanent remote work. He’s been remote for a few years, and COVID helped me land a job that is permanently remote. However, the job’s remote work policies aren’t very robust and it’s pretty dysfunctional.

One reason (among many) I always wanted to work abroad: I wanted to work for a non-US company. I’ve had my share of start-ups and big businesses and I don’t like American office culture, the medical benefits, or the vacation and sick leave policies. The only benefit my current job has is that it’s remote, and the salary is OK.

**Options:**

1. Currently accepted into a *CS BSc program* that is currently offered remotely. Grants would cover tuition costs. My worry here is that I would learn a lot but still may not be employable for remote work after. Would take 2 years to complete.

2. Also applied for *Bootcamp* (Lighthouse Labs) which claims to be an intensive 30week course with 95% job placement. Half the tuition would be covered by grants. (id pay 5000)

Long story short - My boyfriend and I are planning on using Trusted Housesitters as a couple further along into the winter/spring months this year, however other users have said that it's much easier to get chosen for sits if you've already completed a few and have raving past reviews. My boyfriend and I live 1500 miles apart at the moment so we currently can't sign up for Trusted Housesitters together.

Is it possible to join Trusted Housesitters as a singlet and complete sits on my own and then add my boyfriend to the account later on and complete sits as a couple?

I even thought of asking to work in another team. The thing is, my manager and coworkers are all very nice so it was a dilemma for me.

Then, I realized the opportunity it is for me to travel, as I never traveled alone before. I made some research, and found this subreddit, with people who had the same idea. I saw a lot of your posts and the more I read, the more I want to adopt the DN lifestyle.

For context, I'm a late-career professional who would otherwise be retired. But retirement is boring - mind is too active - so I work with small companies that excite my passions. It's very amenable to remote-ing.

Stage 2 is incorporating AI to continually build in more data (scraped from open sources) and help the engine learn as it goes.

Any recommendations on approach, language, or coding would be appreciated.  Thanks guys!"
pcdbrl,19ti2pcl,"Good digital nomad jobs for retired Philosophy Professor, F, late 40's?","I've recently retired from decades of teaching at a University and am an emeritus Philosophy Professor. I hold a Ph.D. in this discipline, and I have transferrable skills in teaching as well as a lot of program management and data analysis done for my University. Also, I am an expert-level writer and totally at ease online. I learn quickly.    


I'm considering leaving the US, but my pension hasn't quite kicked in and won't for a while. So, I am considering going full digital nomad.   


Unsure what kinds of jobs I might do? I realize I have an odd set of qualifications, but I just need enough to live on, and I don't necessarily want to work absolutely full time or even in my field, per se: I've paid my dues there already. Actually, in my dream world, of course I am just snorkeling. But in my reality world, I am living somewhere else and working perhaps 4-6-ish hours a day, making enough to at least keep a (comfortable) roof over my head.   


Any ideas about what might work for someone like me?"

pcl7ot,jr5p1,Where can I teach English?,Hey guys I’m starting the DN thing in Mexico City soon. First time DN as an online English teacher. I’m wondering where would be a good place to teach? I’m gonna start by living in hostels to get a good feel of the locale and to keep my spending low at least initially. I’m guessing hostels probably aren’t a good place to do my work. I’m also not sure about coffee shops. It might be noisy and distracting. I don’t really make enough money to justify getting a coworking space and I think that may be noisy too. I suppose my best bet may be to rent an apartment or Airbnb and just teach from my room? I also need ok internet for video calls.

Also, I don't mean to cause any controversy. I don't think it is a deliberate process but rather it is how societies develop.** 

It seems to me that around the world, there's this myth, ""If you work hard anyone can succeed."" However, it seems that this isn't the case. It seems that there are other factors at play. 

**Three key factors:**

1-Nationality(Access to higher wages, ability to travel, ""positive stereotypes"" that could help for job or dating opportunities) 

2-Language (Access to more resources unavailable in other languages, access to more powerful markets)

3-Wealth( Keeps you afloat if you make mistakes, 

**Country A**: Country A is wealthy and has a lot of ""soft power"" meaning culture they produce is the most desirable one around the world. Say you are person A, a average person from this country. You probably make more money than most people on Country B, regardless of your career. Country A seems to be insular, meaning they don't take embrace cultures that are not theirs. 

**Country B:** Country B is developing country. It has no ""soft power"" and being familiar with its culture brings no prestige. Say you person B, an average person from this country. You work hard and have a good career but even then it's unlikely you will have ""social mobility."" It seems that some developing societies are much more hierarchical where social mobility is harder. It ironic but the elite of country B actually learns the language of Country A. Hence some of the ""elite offspring"" of this nation has adopt a similar culture to country A."

Can I still work internationally sometimes?,"Currently WFH for a small start-up - I've been able to work anywhere in the world as long as I work mostly a PST schedule. I recently got a job offer for a large corporation that nearly tripled my salary - the role is also remote. Went from 80k to almost 200k.

The piece i'm curious about is, since this is a much larger employer - is it safe to still work internationally occasionally? Say I wanted to work in Mexico for 3 months - is this something I need to notify them about? Or can I just do it - and not let them know? (I will not change my home residence and still pay California tax fyi) Will they know via the VPN and fire me? lol

My concern is this larger employer might be more restrictive if I brought this up before accepting any offer. I'm also debating whether working for a large corp is worth it for the extra pay - I really enjoy my flex life right now. The ability to work on the projects I enjoy, and travel the world.. I just don't get paid market rate.

My girlfriend and I were living in Playa Del Carmen for 8 months and have now been in Mexico City for two weeks. We were both super excited to leave the beach life and head to the city. However, it’s not all what we hoped.

While the food and people and culture is great, and the city itself really incredible, we feel down and low-energy day to day here and a general lack of enthusiasm and can’t really figure out why. We both are city people (she’s from Dallas and I’m from Philly) but there’s something about being back in a big city instead of the beach that seems to be getting us down. We can’t figure out if it’s the lack of sun, warm weather, or relaxed feeling of beach life. 

We almost feel bad about it because we wanted to really love Mexico City, but all day we long for the beach again. 

Does anyone have experience with this feeling?

Dubai: $5k/month

Iceland: $7700/month

Definitely not from a location-independent, nomadic kind of job! And I do have some experience, from living in Taiwan and China for six years.

2) buy local prepaid sim cards for the countries I visit

option 1 I imagine would be significantly more expensive, while in return allowing me to use my existing US phone number to send/receive texts. 

option 2 I imagine to be the cost-effective route, but in doing so, I expect I would have to drop my US phone number, or otherwise keep a US plan going that I wouldn't be there to use, then forward text/voicemail somehow? I'm worried here about not having a consistent phone number for 2-factor authentication and the like.

What are your setups? Any clever, cost-effective solutions here or should I just pick the best value international plan I can find?"

pea3cg,u6he1,Nomads without a home base: how do you protect important documents and credit cards?,"I am considering taking all my important documents and credit cards with me to Latin America where I'm going to stay at least for a few months. I already scanned all my documents and shredded the ones I don't need, so what's left is in a big folder that weighs about 4 pounds and fits in a backpack (so weight and volume are not an issue). 

Every now and then I read about nomads and travelers who get their backpack stolen at an airport or their apartment is robbed etc, especially in Latin America. The thought of something like this happening to me really scares me. I've traveled quite a lot and had a couple of close calls when I either almost lost my backpack or almost got robbed. I am much more cautious now but it could still happen. 

Another option I am considering is renting a bank deposit box in the city where currently live. It's not super expensive (about $70/year plus deposit) but if I keep some of my documents there I'll have to come back to that city to collect the documents at some point, so there is less flexibility. I don't have any family nearby, and my friends are nomads as well so I can't leave my stuff with them.

I have a few logistical questions because I want the fuck out, **now**. I've started looking into DN visas for a number of countries (Croatia, Germany and Portugal specifically). My husband won't be able to get a sabbatical until next summer but we're thinking of taking a few years to do the DN visa travel thing. 

I work online making about $10k a month. My husband does some online work too. He doesn't make nearly as much, but he would likely be able to focus on that when he's done with grad school/his work.

I see a lot of posts asking about DN visas but not much info from people who have actually received them, so I wanted to ask those who know firsthand how it goes.

**So my questions are:**

1. Where did you get your visa? Did it take a long time?
2. Did you apply for the visa in person or online? I'm seeing that most need to be filed in person.
3. Would you suggest the DN visa over other options (tourist visa, etc)?
4. If applicable, how was the process of getting your spouse to go with you?

I could literally pack up today and gtfo but my husband's passport is pretty weak, so we're taking this route. The other option I've considered is just figuring out how to move to Istanbul before starting the visa process.

Literally, ANY advice anyone has on this process would be so helpful. I am not picky about where we go, I just want to live somewhere I can walk down the street without getting trash thrown at me. 

Thanks!!

I didn't really know much about this area until I visited her and I gotta tell you: it's awesome over there!

I spent a whole month trying to live as a local digital nomad [(even made a video about the experience)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZNtxTIrnLQ) and I've got so much of it. It might not be in your next go-to list but I'm telling you that you gotta give a try if you live in US and work remotely.

What's cool about it?

* Caribbean lifestyle. It's just an area of islands, everywhere. A chill vibe, most people are very friendly.
* Tons of water activities. Diving of course, it's a must here, but you can paddle through mangroves or go on a boat.
* Food and beers. They have two local breweries, with very delicious beers. Plenty of seafood options even tho I didn't try as I'm getting more into vegan food (which they have a few options).
* Roadtrip shenaningans. The island chain is divided by 5 sections and there's so many places to discover: a diving museum, turtle hospital, etc.

What's lacking?

* Cheap accommodation. The main downside of this area is the prices, everything is a bit expensive: airbnbs, hotels, transportation.
* DN community. There's not many nomads here as people think it's only for retirees, or also, well because it's a bit expensive.

Anyway, all the island have their unique style.

* Key Largo and Islamorada is where you can live and eat all of the options, plus get to all the diving spots.
* Marathon is where you can get to the beach.
* The Lower Keys are just for views, island hopping and finding the Key deers.
* Key West is the tourist destination with lots of parties, coffee shops and just fun.

So have you been to the Keys? If you are making a good buck and work remotely just give it a try, you'll have so much fun there."

pfx70l,4pqeecuj,What salary grade should remote workers ask for?,"I  transitioned to a digital nomad lifestyle in the middle of pandemic after we were allowed temporary remote work. I am fully vaccinated and is currently staying in Mexico, which made me realize that I dont want to return to office anymore.

I recently found a job application that offered full and permanent remote IT job with the same job description that Im doing now. I am employed in the Philippines doing an IT offshore job and my clients are either from the US or Europe but my salary grade is based in relation to the job market of a developing country. Still, even in the Philippines I am earning 5 times the average salary of my local colleagues for almost the same job due to my years of experience, and other exceptional skills etc which is why I am able to sustain this lifestyle. 

However, upon checking the salary offered by the remote job that im planning to apply, the median income they have there is like 3 times than my current salary. The employer is based in the US and so its salary level is higher. I would like to know, considering that its job market is global, how do companies set salaries for remote jobs? Should i base my baseline pay on the the range that they offer in their ads, or do they base it on where I come from? Or where im staying. Im planning to get a temporary residency in portugal next year. How do you calculate your salary grade for your job and experience as a global remote worker?"

pg0f20,dit6or7h,"How to find ""coworkers"" to ""work from home"" together with?","I basically want an in-person version of FocusMate. I'd love to find someone to--safely during this pandemic--work together with. Ideally we'd work afternoons together a couple days a week, but I'd be flexible. They could come to my house (very large yard, walkable/convenient location, multiple outdoor seating options \[table/desk, hammock, benches, picnic style\], extra monitor to share, strong/stable fiber wifi) or I could travel to them if they have enough outdoor space to distance with strong wifi.

I've been looking since 2020, but haven't been able to find anyone. Here are some of the places I've tried:

* NextDoor posts
* posts on FocusMate (found others in other cities who were down)
* reaching out to and asking the people I do know in the area (neighbors/acquaintances/friends)
* posts/comments in a couple community tech groups on Meetup, Slack groups
* reached out directly to other software engineers who live in my city (1/10 received a response, and that person is somehow going into the office)

So, what else can I try? Where do I look? Any takers here? (I'm in Miami.) I live in a major metro city and have been and continue to be shocked that I've been stuck working completely alone for years; I have a hard time believing that there isn't anyone who'd prefer to work in person with others at least some of the time, but I don't know how to find those people, and my attempts have been failing. Most of work isn't spent talking with those around you, but that shared silent energy was a magic that just can't be replicated.

\*to state the obvious, coworking spaces are flagrantly, infuriatingly unsafe and have been this whole year here. No vaccination verification. No mask mandates. Spaces are indoors. I also thought about finding a roommate, but I'd need someone immunocompromised or similar since we'd be same-household, and haven't found anyone."

I primarily handle litigation matters for my company, i.e., I serve as lead counsel in certain cases that we are involved in, either as plaintiff or defendant, and otherwise work with outside counsel on other cases that I am not personally handling.  As in-house counsel, I only have one client: my company.  

My wife and I have always wanted to live abroad, and have lately been thinking of moving to Spain for 1-2 years.  With e-filing and many depositions and hearings being conducted remotely these days (due to Covid, not sure if things will remain this way), I think, as a practical matter, that litigating U.S. cases from abroad is doable (particularly because I only serve one client).  But I am concerned with whether this will run afoul of any attorney ethics rules.  That is, are there any ethical issues with a U.S./Texas-licensed attorney practicing in a foreign jurisdiction in which such attorney is not licensed?

So with what I used to earn, I don't think I would have enough to survive.   


Are there any legal solutions to reduce this tax with a company in the UK (or somewhere else) and to pay myself in dividends? Is this not worth it for a small company? Should I investigate Estonias E-residency or would that not really make a difference? Should I just expatriate?

pjaimo,ebrwg,What to look for in a long-term Airbnb listing ...from someone who's spent the last year in a half dozen locations,
pjbpsq,3zfqzah,Which skills would you learn if you didn't have any yet?,"I am at a point where I have very, very unsporadic work and couldn't rely on it at all. I do stuff like transcriptions and translations, so I know it's because I am unskilled and bring nothing to the table really. The market is overrun with language workers, especially ones without degrees in it. Everyone can do this, and does. 

So I need to learn a skill but everyone you ask just tries to have you build up ""passive income"". They're basically just projecting their personal dreams and stuff they have on their instagram feeds... Talking about atuff like ""Write a book"" and ""Start a blog"". 

No doubt you can make money with that, but let's be real. It's a lot of work, sometimes years before you get anything back. It's very unreliable and not highly likely to succeed anyways. 

Those things are things you do on the side but you don't aim for a livelihood from it. 

Skills and freelancing are the way to go. But back to my question - which? 

Are there skills one can (realistically, without being a boy genius) learn in a couple of months and then start to earn money with it? 

My goal is really around 500-1000 quid a month. I don't need to be rich from this work. 

So real talk here. What's good. What would you choose for yourself if you had to start again nowadays? What would you avoid?"
pjeuix,8sdmz,Quick rundown about starting my DN life. Any feedback so I can be sure please.,"Hi, I've read through most of the posts on here as a lurker and while I got a lot of ideas and solutions I was wondering if I can get a fine tuning on starting out. I know it will be very basic because I'm trying to keep this post short and need help so bear with me.

34/F
- Working freelance with hopes of advancing into UX design (I do packaging at the moment)
- A relative is willing to let me use their NJ address.
- Previously I only lived in either NJ or NY. 
- Some cushioned savings to mitigate slow work periods but still trying to budget and be responsible.
- Am dead set on Porto, Portugal because I speak the language (2nd gen brazilian) and in research, it's an easier city to navigate/live without a car. (though i have a license and can)
- Thinking of starting it off with 1-2 months because it seems overwhelming to commit longer term but I think I will adapt well.
- I have researched airbnbs and idealist.org but was wondering if anyone knows if negotiating for even 2 months is good grounds for it (I've only read about negotiating for 3+ months)
- I don't think I need a visa unless I stay pass 90 days and want to work within the country without a US home address (correct me if I am wrong)
- Have bad ADHD which is regulated by medication. I falter here because I am not sure if I can get my brand medication or if a doctor can prescribe it to me if I go to one. I weened off a med for something else to start this journey but am hard pressed to be productive without my meds (especially in a new and different place). So any insight would be appreciated.
- Am thinking of 2 checked luggages and a carry on. I downsized but I also think after my first go round that I will know better what to pack. (Wondering though if it's a big flag if I don't have a work visa)
- Have some ashes (my mom) that I would like to keep with me but understandable if it's it's not possible. I have a death certificate and all.


I appreciate the feedback but please don't discourage because I have thought about this a lot and came to a conclusion but i just need some help from some seasoned veterans on how to get it right my first time."

pk0ijt,7m0wvlaq,DN career advice. Want to travel and earn a good wage in my 20s,"Hey guys,

22m here. I possess a diploma of music industry, DJ consistently (when COVID isn't restricting this) own an events management business and currently studying a 6 month cybersecurity bootcamp.

Since graduating high school I've worked various jobs and attempted uni a couple times but nothings really stuck. I'm having a hard time finding what career to pursue and what my next step should be. My plan next year is to travel majority of the year with my girlfriend. I was hoping this bootcamp would allow me to gain some remote work in the field but after doing some more research I've found out this isn't as easy as I'd first thought.

My passion definitely lies within the music industry but travelling will most likely put a hold on this. Anyone have some advice on potential careers that would suit the DN lifestyle? I would consider going back to uni for a degree, perhaps abroad. Just want to find something that I'm 110% committed to and will pay well later down the track.

Just checked the Croatian National Tourist Board's official website and was surprised to see how Croatia seems to be fully embracing and welcoming the digital nomad lifestyle. Their official website seems pretty informative regarding current entry requirements and how to go about getting a year-long DN visa.

Honestly, this is pretty refreshing to see. Especially in a time when it feels like the rest of the world is closing its borders and making international travel, borders, and visa restrictions even more difficult than they already were.

Any DNs out there in Croatia during the 2020/2021 period who could shed insight into how it's been handling the pandemic in terms of lockdowns, restrictions, green pass regulations and overall requirements? 

Would you say it's been an easy place to live in without too much of a disruption to quality of life? 

Is Croatia a good place to live and work and overall DN in? Comfortable? Cost effective?

Here's my situation. I'm 35, live in Los Angeles (born and raised here) and have to move in the next 2 weeks (owner sold building).

Cost of living is pretty high here and to get my own place it would be $2200/month. And to be honest this city has worsened during covid for a variety of reasons.

I run an online business (can't use the word to describe it since that apparently gets posts removed) and have two clients right now so my net income is $1400/month (typo lol)

I have savings to live for at least 2 years (around 120k from a previous business venture) but was thinking of going to Playa Del Carmen ( for 6 - 12 months to grind it out and get to 10k before coming back. Things are moving in a positive direction but I think I can save $1500 - $2500 a month by moving abroad.

I don't have any family where I can put any stuff so I'd have to sell/donate everything pretty much. It is a bit nerve wrecking to pick up and move but I feel as though it's the only wise financial decision. Perhaps I am being too conservative and could ride it out here while supplementing with savings for the time being.

Also I'm single and feel as though I should settle down at this stage in my life so not sure if going abroad would derail that.

Should I just suck it up and find a spot here or do you guys think it's a good idea to go abroad?

pknlkd,u6he1,Any hidden gems (cities and countries) for a nomad who doesn't need reliable high speed internet?,"I am looking for cities and countries that are great for nomads but don't necessarily have reliable high speed internet and may have other small issues (e.g. time zone difference) that make them a poor choice for the ""every day on zoom"" nomad crowd. The idea is that perhaps those places offer better value for money, less jaded locals (because they are not overcrowded with nomads) and maybe even more fun nomads who do something other than working for FAANG or similar companies.

My business doesn't require constant interaction or videocalls so I'm ok with slower and less reliable internet as long as I can log on most of the time and reply to emails within 24 hours or so.

Other requirements and nice to haves:

\-Either open for tourists right now or likely to open up soon

\-Nice weather: I will consider different climates but no extreme temperatures (so no SIberia or Dubai).

\-Friendly locals

\-Some places to party (bars, lounges etc) but nothing crazy

\-Reasonable cost of living

\-Good dating opportunities for a single man in his 30s

\-Relatively low crime

In normal times, I would probably choose a place like Bali or one of the islands nearby (Gili, Lombok etc). Internet is hit or miss, especially outside Bali, and the time zone difference makes it difficult to work US hours. However, Indonesia is closed for tourism, so not an option for now."

* Warm (rain is OK)
* Beaches are a plus
* Some sort of digital nomad community, even if small
* Can get around with bad-to-OK Spanish
* Walkable / don't need to rent a car

pl20k7,a40d5,Considering Spain & Italy,"Hi everyone,

My employer is opening remote working opportunities and I am considering to apply. My shortlist is Spain and Italy. I have a few initial questions and am very early in research phase so would appreciate any feedback you all might have.

&#x200B;

With regards to Spain, was looking predominantly at Andalucia as I frequently visited there for work in the past. Cities like Granada or possibly Alicante, Valencia etc. Malaga feels a little touristy to me but perhaps its just my opinion. Are accommodation options with fast internet plentiful and affordable? (500mbps/1 gig internet). Also, has anyone taken advantage of the expat visa offered where tax can be at a flat 25%?

&#x200B;

For Italy, the main issue seems to be with internet being near universally terrible. Likewise, not really sure on areas and would appreciate recommendations. I’ve also seen there is a similar tax benefit where only 30% or even 10% of your income is taxable if your employer does the right paperwork for you and depending on what region you live in. Again, would very much value any thoughts/experiences here.

&#x200B;

Any other locations would also be very welcome. Have heard Netherlands also is a good option and also has an expat tax system that could be used, though not as generous as above two nations. As a further bit of background, I would be moving with my wife and dog and we’d be looking at remote for 12-24 months before deciding where to go from there.  We’d commit to learning at least survival Spanish/Italian and generally would be looking for a decent place in a nice area, not too far from the city or some green space. Would also look to get a car to improve mobility.

So the majority of this post is a question regarding prepayments on [Booking.com](https://Booking.com). I've learned a lesson from this already as its been stupidly frustrating and not very accommodating to a traveller on a budget. I'll book directly in the future. 

However, this trip is yet to happen and my first stop is Valencia for 8 nights - if anyone has any suggestions of what to see, do, eat and drink in this amazing-looking city, please let me know. Now, on to the problem:

I've had a strange problem with [Booking.com](https://booking.com/) that I've never had. Initially, I was thinking that I was being scammed, but I'm starting to think that it's a weird policy that I've never encountered. Any help would be appreciated.

Basically, I payed £80 prepayment on [Booking.com](https://booking.com/) for 8 nights at a hostel, costing a total of £80 (full prepayment). However, when I got the confirmation e-mail from the hostel, it stated that I must pay in full when I arrive.

I called the hostel to tell them that I had in fact already payed [Booking.com](https://booking.com/) in full, but they told me that they had not been payed and that I would have to pay when I arrived.

[Booking.com](https://booking.com/) have told me that this is nothing to worry about and that it is just a prepayment, but it concerns me that the hostel claim they have not been payed at all.

Is this some sort of situation where I pay again at the hostel, and then the original money from [Booking.com](https://booking.com/) is refunded to my account? Or will the hostel receive payment a couple of days before I arrive or something like this?

I've been really stressed out about this as I am on a tight budget and it feels like I will be paying double the initial amount for my hostel. However, I've seen a couple of posts online that look similar to my problem stating that it is actually a usual procedure and that [Booking.com](https://booking.com/) will refund after a week or two.

Can anyone confirm? I just want to relax and get ready to enjoy my trip but the thought of getting charged double for a shitty hostel is stressing me out. What's more, [Booking.com](https://booking.com/) is an absolute nightmare to get hold of, their live chat and messaging service do not work so I am having to resort to call them on the phone which costs £0.60 per minute!!

I appreciate any response!"

So I have some questions for you all, mainly about living expenses. Does it make sense to start with a ""part time"" nomad lifestyle, just traveling for a week or two and returning home, to get a feel if you're able to do this in the longer term? Or is it more sensible to jump straight into it full-time, in the sense that you're always on the move? Do you still have a ""home base"", one that you pay off/rent?

I've become increasingly interested in digital nomadism and would love to work remotely once I've completed my studies. Despite the fierce competition, it seems as though SDR and BDR positions are the only ones I have a (diminutive) shot at landing with no prior experience. 

I'm considering completing a sales bootcamp and becoming acquainted with the most commonly utilized CRM software. Will that increase my chances to obtain a job within a reasonable time frame (say 2-3 months)? 

Any suggestions, advice, and/or criticisms are welcome."
plss44,181m3usv,Help me decide on an Airbnb,"I'm at a $550/month Airbnb in the capital of a country that has all the needed amenities, including an actual desk setup, big windows, and a balcony.

I can extend my stay here or go to perhaps the worst coastal town in the country with like 2K people because there is a $350/month apartment that is smaller with seating that is not that ergonomic.

I have about $2.5K at my disposal, make about $300 in monthly passive income, and have a client who owes me about $10K that he pays in unpredictably timed installments.

My passive income could increase based on my effort as well as market activity.

To wrap up, my Airbnb dilemma is basically whether to stay at a work-appropriate apartment in a capital or go to a prison-cell-like apartment in a beach town.

I reckon hardcore cheapskates would easily choose the latter, but I've been doing glorious work at this apartment, just not sure whether the work quality would be *that* worse in the ""prison cell"".

**Update: I pulled the trigger and extended my stay in the current nice apartment.**

**It's bittersweet, but I'll try to make sure the RoI compensates for the money lost by not going to that cheaper apartment and more.**"

&#x200B;

Any gamers out there using a 17 or 17.3 inch laptop while being a nomad? 

I will be staying in places like Vienna and Tokyo and Amsterdam for 3 months at a time on average. I will mostly be in my Airbnbs, the city and at cafes. I will be using public transport and walking. I doubt I'll rent a car. 

I have a Zephyrus G14 right now which is convenient as far as size but some more intensive games run at a lackluster framerate or look a bit mushy. Competitive FPS are rough in particular.

I’m a graphic designer, and I’ve been maintaining my work’s archive for multiple years now on an external hard drive (4TB). The problem I have is when I travel/nomading for a few months I have to bring with me this gigantic external hard drive with two cables (one of them is a power cable). That takes up space, and it’s heavy (also afraid I might lose it). I keep the most recent work/reoccurring project files on Gdrive. Ideally I move everything to Gdrive, but it might cost a pretty penny (unless Google makes storage cheaper in a few years).

Wondering if any of you have any better system in place or if you are juggling your files in a similar manner."
pm3te9,1u92dxmq,Thinking of spending the UK winter somewhere warmer inside the EU,"So I had planned on being in Oz by now but covid happened and my visa expired. Now too old to get another.

Does anyone have any recommendations on places in the EU where I could stay where it’s warm whilst the weather sucks over the UK winter? 

Ideally I want to bring my dog with me, he’s still young and not a fan of busy roads and cities. We both love the mountains and beaches and I’d ideally like to be not too far away from civilisation (I’d want to meet people in bars, find a gym etc)

Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated 🙂

pm98c1,dyuu4iu5,PSA for those considering taking their remote job international,"With Covid, a lot of people are doing the work-from-home thing. Many of y'all are considering taking a job in international, which is awesome! Just be very, very careful about international regulations regarding your job.

The unfortunate reality is, most employers don't want to deal with international regulations and taxation, not to mention security issues, privacy issues, client confidentiality, etc. Employers also don't want to deal with time zones, spotty internet, and other variables associated with DN life. An increasing amount of them are embracing the lifestyle! But many still aren't.

Simply ""using a VPN"" will not solve the security issues, nor will it pull the wool over your employers' eyes. Unless you're willing to risk losing your job, don't circumvent their rules and just assume that a VPN is an Invisibility Cloak of Sneakiness.

**A few things to consider as you transition WFH to DN:**

**- You are not going to find high-speed Internet in many, many places.** Particularly less expensive countries. Particularly in short-term rentals. There definitely are some places that are equipped for this! But this is not a global standard. Strolling I've been to Thailand and expecting your $4 a night hostel to have 120 Mbps upload speeds is silly, and banking your job on that is even sillier. If high-speed internet is really important to your job, I suggest finding local backups so you aren't relying on the place you're staying or the cafe you're working in.

**- Talk to your employer.** Transparency is best, plus maintaining the lie can get stressful.

**- Working remotely is not the same thing as working from home.** You will probably not have the same setup, the same ergonomics, the same technological accessories, and conveniences. You'll need to prepare for contingencies, budget accordingly, and be flexible.

**- A lot of places in the world don't understand or care about remote work.** Trying to explain a Zoom call to your neighbor whose children won't stop screaming at the top of their lungs from sun up till sundown, they're not going to understand or care. This isn't their fault, they are at home.  It's not reasonable to expect them to completely alter their life and schedule to accommodate your professionalism. This has been something that I've struggled with a lot, but I have a very understanding employer who understands this is just part of nomading.

**- Try it locally before you go global.** I've met a number of nomads who tried it out domestically, found out that it was not for them, and never made it overseas. This is because you are choosing to forgo a lot of creature comforts in order to travel the world, but you don't really get to see as much as you think you will because you're still working 8, 10, 12 hours a day. It's really fucking cool, but it's not a permanent vacation.

**- Before you completely uproot your life, try being a nomad in another city or another state for a few weeks** to see if you can handle living out of suitcases, not knowing anybody, not having a place to call home in the traditional sense. If the pressure is too much when you can still speak the language and navigate the stores, transportation, and culture that you're already used to, DN lifestyle may not be for you. If you love it and it's exhilarating and as awesome as you were hoping, great! 

Hope this was helpful. DN is super cool and I'm really happy at it, but there are a lot of considerations and things to prepare before you head off :)

**Any other tips for people trying to transition WFH to DN?**"
pmb625,r6o7m,Interviewed and got a job that is remote!,"I spend a good deal of time dispersed camping and occasionally visiting cities with my wife. Our signal booster has never let us down, and we have been able to work productively remotely. 

I interviewed with a new company I was excited about and got an offer that was 15-30% higher than my current job (depending on how much you value stock options, but close to what I believe I am worth regardless).

After the verbal offer, I came clean about how much I was planning to work remotely even post-Covid. I talked to my hiring manager first, who was supportive and intrigued by the lifestyle. I then followed up with HR to make it explicit, and still got the formal offer letter!

We're looking for recommendations for places to consider in Central and South America.  


Our basic criteria for a potential spot:

* Dollar goes far (trying to keep spending relatively low, no budget but \~$3k/mo (including rent) would be ideal)
* Good internet connection, as we all work remotely and will need to be on occasional voice calls
* Walking distance to a beach or body of water
* Flexible on city or town size. We don't necessarily want to be in the heart of a major city, but likewise don't want to be in a small town in the middle of nowhere.

I'm happy to provide more details in the comments. This is the first time any of us are doing something like this in central/south america. So any advice is appreciated!

pmnv73,o15js,Anyone else feel stuck because it’s not as easy to “preview” countries now?,"My story in a nutshell: I was a DN from 2017 till late last year. I started out with no plan and a one-way ticket to Malaysia. I picked up some work along the way, bounced around countries, fell in love with Vietnam, took up cycling, and simply had an awesome life.

A brain tumor sent me back to the US late last year. I’m fine now, but I haven’t made a move or started working again. Vietnam’s handling of the pandemic in 2021 has been atrociously poor, and between that and changing visa regulations, chances are slim I’ll ever get to experience my old life again.

I’m more of a slow traveler, so I prefer to find someplace(s) I love and treat it as a home base as much as is feasible. However, since the world is now a patchwork of restrictions (and flying is now quite unpleasant), it is a lot harder to “try before you buy.” If you don’t like Bali, it’s no longer a given that you can just hop over to Thailand and give it a go, for example. 

Like, I thought about Georgia earlier this year. I had two friends who were DNing there (not together). I couldn’t pull the trigger, though. I just kept thinking, “What if I don’t like it?” And a video chat with one of those friends kinda confirmed my hunch. 

Anyone else feeling like this? Maybe part of it’s due to getting older and having a clearer idea of what you are looking for, as well."

Still in the planning phase, but thought it would be fun to allow others to join.
  
Tentative Dates: January 1, 2022 - March 31, 2022  
  

**Us:**  
35/m, USA. Paid search and analytics consultant  
33/m, Europe. SEO consultant  
* Both of us have a couple side projects/businesses that we run on the side.   
* We're well-established, and while we have simple and inexpensive tastes, we're not looking to shoestring budget this.  
* Introverted, appreciate being fairly close to nature  
* Straight, single white dudes. That's purely FYI * your age/race/gender/religion/relationship status don't matter as long as we get long. We're not looking to make this into a singles retreat.  
* Enjoy a drink or two  
* Outdoorsy  
* Vaccinated  
* 35/m has done much of LA already and speaks enough Spanish to not die. 33/m has never been, but has done most of Europe and some SEA.  
* 35/m is vegetarian, 33/m is occasionally  
* We're not new to this. 35/m has worked remotely for 8 years. 33/m on and off for a couple years.  
  

**Where we want to stay:**  
* Looking at anywhere in Latin America at the moment, but flexible on actual location  
* Want some place with access to nature (preferably water, but mountains work too, bonus points for both)  
* Internet speed is important (needs to support a Zoom call)  
* We don't have a budget in mind, but honestly we're going to be looking at accommodation on the more expensive side wherever we choose. If we get 4-6 people to do this, we'd be looking at getting a nice house somewhere.  
* No sharing bedrooms, we're old. Note: We don't all need to live together. You can stay near by and we can occasionally hang out / work / go on excursions together  
* So, while we're open to suggestions, this is the initial brainstorm list in no particular order: Bacalar MX, Puerto Escondido MX, San Cristobal de las Casas MX, Veracruz MX, Antigua (Guat), Lake Atitlan (Guat), Quito (Ecuador), Bajos (Ecuador), Arequipa (Peru), Montevideo (Uruguay), Florianopolis (Brazil)  
Edit: To be clear we don't want to hop from one to the next.  We're looking to choose 1, or maybe 2, destinations and hunker down for a bit.

**You:**  
Note this depends on whether you're living with us or just nearby for a bit. If it's the latter, who gives a shit you do you and we can pop into eachothers lives as we see fit. If it's the former and we're renting a place together:  
* Remote worker with enough income or savings where you aren't super stressed about it  
* Respect our work times. We enjoy our work and put the hours in. You don't have to, but you would need to respect a working environment during the day.  
* Fairly independent, but add to the social and working atmosphere  
* Healthy and active, likes the occasional outdoor activity  


**Other notes:**  
* We're not looking to make money organizing this or anything like that. Just looking for other cool people to join as we attempt to escape winter.  
* There may be collaboration opportunities if you work in the digital marketing, design, and development space  
* If you have a couple years experience and are looking for a nomad job, if it's a great fit and the price is right one of us could hire you full or part time for the duration of the stay (and perhaps beyond)  
  
If you're interested, feel free to PM us a little info about yourself, dates you might be interested in, and any other qualifiers (only if certain locations, might come but will rent your own place, etc).  
  
If you want to comment with ideas or recommendations for us, or if you'd just like to get updates on where/when we decide to go, just comment and we'll let you know!"

pn32ww,aqnt8wey,How to attract US companies to hire you as an overseas remote contractor,"I'm particularly curious to get thoughts from US companies that have hired foreign corporate contractors working remotely, and also from remote contractors working/having worked for US clients.

I reside in Estonia where I'm running a one-man software development business. I'm planning to start building online presence to find more opportunities in the US market.

Some of the things that carry a lot of value in getting work as a foreigner:

* Language —  Self-evident. Without excellent written and spoken English you're done.
* Verifiable proof of competence — Also goes without saying. With some clients, perhaps more important for you than your US counterparts (due to prejudice against foreigners).
* Business structure — It seems typically undesirable to offer yourself as an overseas employee, unless that's specifically what the businesses hiring say they are looking for. Otherwise, they would have to not only take care of extra domestic paperwork but also deal with foreign employment laws and it's all a big mess; consequently, offering services through a registered foreign business entity seems like the way to go: the hiring company will only pay the bills according to the contract — they don't need to worry about your income taxation, social security payments, employment benefits etc.
* Existing connections — Not only important for foreigners, but here goes: having someone in the ranks of a potential client who knows your skills and can recommend you may give you a HUGE competitive edge.

A bunch of questions related to the post title:

* Other than those already mentioned, what are other most important steps to present yourself in a positive light as a foreign contractor and find work?
* As a non-US person/business, have you faced prejudice from US clients? If so, what did you do to convince them otherwise?
* How to craft your CV/introduction letter? While introducing yourself as a foreign entity, will there be any specific information to absolutely either include or leave out?
* What are some of the things you want to avoid as a contractor when looking for assignments in US? Any culture-related caveats? (i.e. things that may be fine in corporate Europe but not so in America / vice versa)
* Have you persuaded a US business looking for another paid employee to do a corp-to-corp deal instead? How did you make it happen?
* When you're starting as a contractor and your company's references are still few to none, what can you bring to the table to bridge the gap? (past personal/hobby/volunteer projects, blog or other social media posts introducing competence in your field, what else?)
* For contractors, how important is visibility in social media? Which platforms should they be on?
* Do you consider one of the following approaches distinctly more successful that the other for a remote contractor? If so, why?
   * a) ""I'll chase after the work"" — actively responding to job ads.
   * b) ""I'll let the work chase after me"" — actively demonstrating your expertise online and waiting for leads to get in touch with you."

2. Hikes or walkable routes in the area ⛰️🥾🌲 - with my injury I hike and walk mornings to keep up with my progress, and I love nature
3. Easy to meet locals & nomads 🍷🌮💃🏻

pnc9nx,7ifn2otd,Create website for nomads,"Hello everyone 👋
First off, pardon me for the formatting, I used my phone to make a post while standing in a boarding queue. 

I was thinking to create an open source digital nomad website and make it available at relatively low subscription plans or maybe make it totally free. In short, making money is not the primary goal.

I believe there're lots of professional developers and many other professionals in this community who could make this happen and make it outstanding from any other alternatives 

Since working remotely became ""normal"" in our lives and being a digital nomad is getting even more popular,  I believe we could make an awesome platform specifically meant for nomads.

I know there're already such platforms, such as nomadlist.com and others. Even myself tried out it in the past, but I just think it's overpriced and it should be available at lower sub/plans since the users themselves share/populate the information. 

Please feel free to criticize the idea and share your thoughts on this."

pndi0f,14giso,Always notice these same 4 groups of people: anyone else?,"Hi all. So I've been working remotely for 8 years - a bit long in the tooth but it's been a great ride. Most of my time has been spent in Latin America. If you've traveled between Mexico and Argentina, I've probably been there. One of the things I've noticed is that digital nomads/expats tend to all naturally orbit around one another, and whenever I hit up a new town or region, I seem to run into the same 4 groups of foreigners:

1. Fauxhemians: These are usually young people who are easily identified by their attire, they look like they're on their way home from Woodstock. Their dress hides the fact that they are living conspicuously posh for people without jobs, although every once in a while you'll see them ""working"" in places like Yoga Retreats or Co-ops. How they really get their money is anyone's guess, but they tend to have very relaxed body language and seem to be quite pleased with themselves.
2. The YouTube/Instagram/Drone crowd. These people are here to film and document EVERYTHING. Buying fruit from a local vendor must be filmed. They must take pictures of themselves with local young poor children, smiling for the camera as if they've helped these kids escape poverty, when in fact they only meet them for a fleeting photo op. Follow the buzzing sound of the drones to catch them out in nature.
3. The Volunteers. Bless these people. Young, idealistic, and ready to solve the world's problems, these young folks are out there riding the city bus in places like Guatemala City and going places even the locals won't go. You won't often interact with them because they're too busy working in a school by the city dump - and all too often they don't stay long enough to make real connections. Like I said, bless these people.
4. The Retirees. This is a diverse group but I've got to lump them into one big pile. The main giveaway is that they're over 65 and none of them speak the local language. They came for the weather and the cost of living. You can find them posting on facebook begging every friend back in the US, Canada, and Europe to come and join them.

ETA: OK, so I didn't say these were the ONLY groups out there. I am just saying I notice these same particular groups of folks in most nomad-friendly areas. There are exceptions of course. Just was having a bit of fun and seeing if others agree or wanted to add/share their experiences. "

Since the start of this project, I've been considering the DN lifestyle. My 2 best friends say absolutely go for it, as I have a good remote job and do fairly well with day to day challenges of travel.

However, being an only child, my mom is horrified (as in hurt, not angry) by the idea, to the point she can't even stand me talking about it with her. Being almost 40, yes, I can make my own choices. But I do care about my mother, and don't want her to live the next few years of her life stressed to the max or crying herself to sleep. Still, I want to be able to live out my dreams without hurting anyone in the process.

pnl6y2,divamypr,Has anyone else thought: What is the point of making a lot of money if you don't get to enjoy it? (A suburban life doesn't sound enticing at all),"**PS:This is not a ""rant"" just an observation.** 

Hey guys,

One pattern I have noticed of many people in the West/Anglosphere is that many of them are wiling to do anything as long as they get paid a lot of money and horde the money as well. 

I think money is important, however, I believe you reach a **""wealth threshold""** where you don't need more money to enjoy your life. In fact, I believe most people who live in a developed country can reach this threshold somewhat easily when they are somewhat young. 

The problem with the Anglosphere model is that many people tend to believe that there is ""reward"" afterlife. However, if you were atheistic you might think differently. 

I believe there's a balance between hedonism and asceticism but I think most of the Western societies choose the extreme asceticism. Maybe this might be good for the nation as a whole but I don't think its good for the individual.

For instance, many people advocate to settle down in your late twenties, buy a house, move to the suburbans, raise a family. However, all of this will come at a  **personal cost.** 

For instance, if you are young man in your late 20s you might now have money to buy a small apartment for yourself in a big city and then you can have a online business and from them start traveling. I think this is age **where you are actually the MOST free,** free from parents, free from teachers, free from roommates or free from bosses. 

Why would you take away your own FREEDOM, when it has been very difficult to get here in the first place?"

pnu347,aqg7k,AMA + An insider's review of the highest paying freelance platforms,"Hello all!

I'm in the unique position of having used many different platforms for freelance work, and I've been accepted in many of the more premium/exclusive ones as well. In this post I'll review the best three I've used so far, which are Toptal, BrainTrust and 10xManagement. I've also used Upwork, Freelancer, Elance and Fiverr both as an employee and employer.

Why are those three the best? For **experienced** freelancers (they all require experience and are very hard to get accepted into), these platforms will give you the best clients, which means the best wages and the best projects. All three are also very professional and will support their talent better than a low-end freelance site. Not to say they are perfect, all of them have issues, but they're better than the current alternatives.

Let's go!

# [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/X9noVK/worlds-top-talent)

Toptal is the biggest one of those three (maybe the biggest premium platform overall) and has the most jobs, by far. It is the most well-known of the three, and as such, they are in a dominant position in this market and they know it, so they can charge higher fees for example.

They are a typical marketplace in which, once approved, you get to see all the listings and apply to them. Because you've already been technically vetted by Toptal, clients usually won't test you, and the interviews are mostly to check communication and fit.

### Jobs

At this moment, there are [127 jobs](https://i.imgur.com/y8r7W87.png) that have been added within the last 7 days. This doesn't include jobs that require a specialization, if you include those, then it's over 150. These are serious clients that had to put in a deposit to create a job posting.

If your goal is to get hired as fast as possible, Toptal wins out here, and there is also a good diversity of contracts.

The quality of the jobs/employers vary, you can find a contract with Airbnb on there or you can find a contract with a small startup. Overall, there is a minimum standard, and you won't find a truly terrible/broke client on there, clients are vetted and must put down a deposit.

### Rates

Expect between $40-100/h for the vast majority (90%+) of roles. 

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/XBtEVd4.png) is a chart directly from Toptal that shows what a client is expected to pay per hour for their talent. If these numbers look higher than what I wrote above, that's because the talent doesn't see those rates.

In Toptal, the neither client nor the talent know each other's rate, the talent sets his own rate and the client will see the talent's rate with the Toptal fee already added on top. This varies, but generally the Toptal fee is about 50% (!) of the talent rate, so if your rate is $60, the client might pay 80-100/h for you. 


### Joining Toptal

It is pretty difficult to get accepted in Toptal, there are five steps in the interview process and some require good algorithmic knowledge, others require a lot of free time. They get hundreds of applicants per day because of how well-known the platform is.

To join, simply go [here](https://topt.al/Zzc4yv) and sign up, you'll be contacted for the first step of the interview in a bit.

The first step is a simple interview to test your English and communication skills. Next, they’ll send you a codility test to complete. If you pass that, you’ll get a technical interview with an engineer, who might ask algorithmic type questions as well. After that, you’ll have a take home project to complete, and a final interview demonstrating the project you’ve built.

# [Braintrust](https://www.usebraintrust.com/join-engineer?utm_source=talent&utm_medium=community&utm_campaign=dc_ref)

Braintrust is the newest one here. It was founded in 2018 but it's only really starting to pick up in popularity recently. The overall process overall is fairly similar to Toptal, you go through an interview process, and once approved, you apply to positions.

They are already working with large companies such as NASA, Porsche, Deloitte, Nike etc.

One interesting quirk of Braintrust is that they are trying to make the platform more ""decentralized"", and ""talent-owned"". They have their own crypto (btrst) which launched recently, and btrst holders will be able to vote on proposals to the platform (governance), theoretically even important things like modifying the fees could be voted upon.

### Jobs

At this moment there are 40 jobs in the last 7 days. Most are development jobs, but there are also jobs for Product Management, Project Management, Designers and more, same as Toptal. There are also jobs that don’t fit into those buckets, such a communications manager, copywriter and such, so it’s still worth considering for non-traditional remote roles.

The jobs are very competitive so it’s difficult to get hired. The clients are high quality and there are a lot of approved Freelancers, some whom are very good, so you need to really stand out. I expect the balance to change soon as the platform aims to onboard more clients.



### Rates

The rates at Braintrust are pretty good. Braintrust only takes 10% from the client and 0% from the talent, so you nearly get the rate the client pays. The vast majority of roles pay between 50-150/h, although there are some outliers on both sides.

### Joining Braintrust

Simply sign up [here](https://www.usebraintrust.com/join-engineer?utm_source=talent&utm_medium=community&utm_campaign=dc_ref). You’ll enter a waiting list before getting interviewed. Fill out your profile as much as you can as it might accelerate the time it takes you to get an interview.

The waiting list is pretty short at the moment but that might change as the network might gain a lot of publicity soon.

As for the process itself, it’s a fairly simple one, there is an initial screening call in which your communication skills will be evaluated, a second stage in which you’ll be asked to complete a coding challenge and a third stage which is the behavioral and technical interview. The interviews are not challenging per se, however, Braintrust is very selective and thus you need your communication and technical skills to be on point.

# [10x Management](https://10xmanagement.com/)

This one is a little bit more secretive, but it is nonetheless a very good option for highly skilled freelancers and possibly the one with the highest rates overall.

The owners used to manage music talented and pivoted to manage tech talent, in a similar manner, and they’ve done so pretty successfully. For their permanent talent, they somewhat “guarantee” that they’ll find you work full-time or part-time, as they would with entertainment talent, and for that reason they have very few engineers whom are very highly qualified. If they are representing you, they will also do as much as they can to ensure you get paid by the client, up to assisting in legal matters.

They are not a marketplace per se like the other two, you don’t have access to the list of all positions, a 10x agent will contact you directly when they have an opportunity for you and you get to either accept or refuse an interview with the client for that position.

### Jobs

Due to the nature of how they work, I can’t really know how many jobs they have available, I can only know about the ones they contact me for, or sometimes they’ll ask everyone for a job that is specifically difficult to fill. My guess is they likely don’t have too many openings at a time, maybe 10-30, but they do have a lot of talent working on long-term engagement.

If you manage to become officially represented by 10x, they would generally find you enough opportunities to fill your time, but getting represented as such is very difficult. They have A-tier customers as well, such as BMW, Berkeley, Ebay, Nordstrom, Yelp etc.

However, they are moving away from that model somewhat and most of the new talent instead gets a non-exclusive contract, in which they can work on other projects too and 10x doesn’t guarantee to fill their time.

### Rates

The rates at 10x are the highest of all 3 and generally start at around 175/h. If you’re a super specialist or you have very impressive experience, you can sometimes double or even triple that. It’s also possible to get a lower rate than that, although anything under 100 would be pretty much unheard of. As for the fees, they are charged to the talent and are generally about 15% for represented individuals, and 25% for the non-exclusive folks. 

### Joining 10x Management

Joining 10x is close to impossible. They make that very obvious as they don’t even have a form to apply as talent. Essentially, they’ll be the ones reaching out to you if you’re a truly great engineer or you’re very well known.

That’s probably pretty disappointing reading this after I tell you about their amazing clients and rates...but well… there may be another way. As 10x comes from entertainment talent management, they view relationships as extremely important. So essentially, if you want to get in, you need to both be talented and know someone on the inside that can refer you and vouch for you. Check your linked in contacts properly (build them if you have a poor network), maybe you already know someone that’s part of the network..

As for the process to join the network one you’re in the pipeline, it’s a fairly simple process, you’ll have a call with the founder to ensure you have the right communication style (communication is the most important thing in 10x), and if that goes well, you’ll have another interview with an engineer. If that goes well, then you’re in, and you’ll start getting emails once in a while for potential gigs.

=========

# Ending words

There you have it. If you’ve got some experience under your belt and/or a good portfolio, give a shot to a few of these, and if you get rejected the first time, try again in 6 months. None of these platforms will reject you “permanently”, unless you do something stupid, keep studying and working hard and apply again later. Feel free to ask me anything in the comments!

I’m a 35 year old European woman and will be going with my dog. 
My main requirements are being close to the beach, having a good internet connection and living somewhere where it’s relatively safe to walk around at night as a single woman. I don’t mind tropical heat. 
I’m not into major tourist destinations/environments and don’t need to live in a bigger city, but I would appreciate a place with some sort of international community/social life that’s not too much of a party scene.

I’m planning on renting my own place, preferably a small house or apartment. I’m on a relatively decent budget, but would prefer somewhere that’s not too expensive concerning accommodation.

I really liked the Mazunte/Zipolite area when I went there a couple of years ago, but it didn’t feel very safe to walk around at night and I’ve heard Internet in that area isn’t reliable for working.

If so, how has your experience been so far and would you recommend it?

For those not in the know, in a nutshell, you not need to quarantine if you fly into Phuket and spend two weeks in that area. After the two weeks is up you are free to move elsewhere in Thailand, if you wish. There's some other requirements which you can see in the link. 

Where I currently live (east asian country) gets very cold in the winter so I like the idea of heading to Thailand to spend some time living on the beach. I heard Phuket is much quieter now (obviously) so it's nice for those who aren't bothered about partying etc but want a cheap outdoor, healthy lifestyle.

po6ot0,,Medication question,"Hey all, working on logistics of doing a DN lifestyle starting mid next year. I'm currently on 2 medications that I feel might be a little trickier than your typical blood pressure medication etc: testosterone cypionate and Nardil (an old MAOI antidepressant).

Testosterone is controlled, Nardil isn't. But Nardil is in a worldwide shortage, even hard to get in the US at times.

I was considering a couple of options to take these with me without interruption:

1. Visit my family 1-2x a year and stock up. The test bottles are tiny, and last 2-3 months each. I would need to bring a lot of needles though. The Nardil, being as old as it is, requires that I take 6 pills a day (just not as efficient as we are now). I'd be bringing a LOT of bottles.
2. Have my family try to ship them once I'm settled somewhere. If they are confiscated though, it would be a major issue and hard to replace.

My real question is - I've heard it's fine to bring a 3 month supply of medication with you. But has anyone tried 6-12 months worth? Thanks :)"

1. [Mogics MA-1](https://www.mogics.com/2935-2). This is super neat and small, so small it fits the Schuko socket. It's my current favorite. Replacing the UK required fuse is super tricky though.
1. [Road Warrior RW101BK](http://www.warrior.co.jp/E/product/rw101/). Super nice and flat but the lack of UK fuse is a serious negative. The earlier RW75BK had many knockoffs, most well known from Kikkerland, this is the improved original. Don't buy the Kikkerland adapter any more.
1. Wonpro Nano. This is dead in the water currently because most Schuko sockets now have child protector covers and the tiny legs you screw out can't exert enough pressure to open those. This is why it is important the similarly structured Mogics MA-1 fits inside the Schuko socket. Oh and this is not fused either IMO.

powjev,ghy0l,Tax advice for a dual citizen digital nomad with a US based job living in Europe,"I just recently got a new remote working position that pays ~90k a year, and they were OK with me relocating to Europe, but for paperwork I give them a US address. I'm in a somewhat unique position of being a dual citizen of the USA and Ireland (an EU country), so I'm taking full advantage of that by earning a high US wage but living (relatively) cheaply in Europe with a higher standard of living.

My question is: How would you recommend I structure my taxes? I don't mind paying tax, but obviously I'd like to be as efficient as possible and also avoid double taxes. I'm also willing to shift which EU state to live in if it makes a big difference. 

My thinking is to first shift my American residence to a no tax state by, for example renting a PO Box in Nevada, or using a family members house in Florida. This way I avoid all state/local tax. The next question is how I should handle the rest of my taxes? How exactly should I think about structuring my general tax burden, and is there any advice for how to correctly file taxes? As a dual citizen, are there any special strategies available to me that wouldn't be to others?"

So my question is, is it worth it to have the student loans and go to this school (which I really do like btw) if afterwards all I will want to do is become a digital nomad? Any advice would be much appreciated, thank you."

Always assumed the only way I could see other countries while working was to move there with a job there, but I recently learned about being a digital nomad and want to do it.

I'm reading up on how to do it and other research and I'm just curious if there is any consensus in the community on a good first destination for new digital nomads? Or is there really no such thing and it wildly depends on the individual's circumstances and where they want to go first? 

I am a female in early 20s from the US and I just got an online job so that's my stats I guess. I am thinking of starting in Spain or Croatia because they seem cool. I'm looking for something that would be decently cheap and easy to adjust to and where tech/internet/phone connections wouldn't be an issue.

ppbnkv,4fjcizo4,Romania as a digital nomad destination,"Hey All,

As someone relatively new to posting here I thought I'd start with sharing what I hope is some helpful information for my fellow nomads.   
I don't see a lot of digital nomads saying too much about Romania, so I figured I'd add my two cents worth. 🙂

As far as I know there isn't much of a digital nomad community in Romania, which is a shame for several reasons including

A) It's crazy affordable. From food to lodging to transportation, Romania is way closer to neighboring Bulgaria than to neighboring Hungary, and far more affordable than Western Europe. 

😎 It's not in the Schengen Zone! 

C) Really good internet almost everywhere.

D) Absolutely beautiful and vibrant. 

I can't speak to what Bucharest is like, though friends of ours did not love it. 

Instead we spent our time in Brasov and Sibiu, both in Transylvania. 

As far as I know, neither have any proper coworking but both have tons of coffee shops where it was easy to work. 

Both also have great old towns with huge plazas and charming narrow streets. Brasov actually has the larger population but Sibiu has a much larger old town. 

Sibiu also has a very active culture scene. During our month there the town hosted some kind of festival -- jazz, movie, car racing -- almost every single weekend. 

Meanwhile, Brasov has fantastic access to nature. It's nestled right at the foot of Mt. Tampa, so you can literally be hiking in minutes. And for even better hiking all you have to do is hop on a bus to Poiana.

We look forward to going back and exploring both Cluj and Timisoara. 

We didn't spend any time in Bucharest because only one person we know had anything nice to say about it. Instead we headed for Brasov and Sibiu.  


Hope this helps my fellow DNs looking for great places to go."

Background: I have older siblings whom have families of their own. I had been living away for a number of years, happily living the nomad life. Then covid hit...  


I have now been back for almost 2 years - back in the town i was so glad to leave and only visit once a year to see family and friends around Christmas time...  


Now, since being back at the start of the pandemic, both my parents' health has started to decline, and i feel obliged to help. I love them both very much and i do want to help, yet, i'm starting to feel very pessimistic about ever getting out of here again...  


My dad's physical health is declining and my mum's mental health is going (onset dementia). I don't know what the future holds but the very thought of having to live in this town for a number of years  sickens me, and right now i just cannot see a light at the end of the tunnel.   


I know it sounds selfish, but i worry about my own sanity being in this house, and this town. A town i outgrew years ago. A town where people happily chat about the most inane shit you can possibly imagine. Yesterday I was trapped in a conversation about candles. This went on for minutes but in my mind but it felt like eternity.  


I just needed to vent and wondered if anyone else has any idea on how to get through this or any kind of solution. I know it's a first world problem but it's getting me down nonetheless.   


TLDR: I miss my freedom. Freedom to do what the digital nomads do and live a fun pleasurable life on my own terms. Trapped by family constraints i cannot see a way out of here..."

I've heard Tanzania, Ghana, Mauritius, and Morocco have some nice spots, but I'm looking for somewhere to go in February/March and it looks like that's the worst time of year weather-wise for Mauritius (also Reunion, which would otherwise be appealing). Africa is appealing for timezone reasons (I need 3 hours of overlap with UTC-0 and prefer keeping normal, i.e. during the day, working hours).

I've been to Marrakesh and Nairobi and had fine experiences but wouldn't go back -- felt unsafe and quickly ran out of options for safe activities outside of working hours. Has anyone else had good experiences DNing in Africa? Where did you go, what was it like, what would you recommend? I'm aware of slow/patchy internet and expensive rent for safe neighbourhoods and am fine with both, I'm more looking for hidden gems out there with a vibrant DN/expat community, options for evening/weekend activities, and nice weather.

pqclwt,2yhjqrsb,Where in Gran Canaria for…,"Hey! Me, my partner and baby are planning on spending November in Gran Canaria for a remote working/holiday mix. We’re early-mid 30s and wondering where abouts on the island to stay.

Wants:
Self catered villa with a small pool. We’ll hire a car so don’t need to be that close to shops or bars. We like beaches, snorkelling, hiking, exploring canyons, caves, different scenery. We like greenery though the dryer and warmer weather in the south looks inviting. Within 25 mins of few laid back bars/restaurants would be good.

Not so bothered about:
Nightlife, being in the city, meeting others (casual interactions welcome of course!), co-working spaces or much more than a couple of days of sight seeing.

The difficulty seems to be that the vibe in the north seems more like us but weather and direction towards the sun on the beaches in the south would suit us, but not the nightlife. Of course, we’ll have a car so it seems like an hour’s drive to everywhere so perhaps location isn’t overly important? 

We’ve been to the south of Tenerife in winter. Clear days we’d go to the beach and cloudy days we’d head up the mountain to get above them so we’re probably fine wherever we stayed but any thoughts based on the above from those in the know would be much appreciated. 

Oh budget would top out around $3500 for the month on accommodation which seems viable. Bit of a blow out for us after COVID and a chance to sample the DN lifestyle.

I've been working on starting my journey as a DN over the summer. I can't currently commit to full-time traveling due to responsibilities in the UK, so I am aiming to make biweekly trips to European cities. The plan was to fund this through freelance writing jobs. 

I am currently on my first 'trial' trip to Valencia for 8 days. The whole trip was more expensive than I wanted it to be due to Covid testing, eating out for every meal, and generally learning how to budget properly. But including travel, accommodation and leisure I will have spent around £400. 

I've been working for 3 to 4 hours most mornings doing writing jobs on UpWork, and I just worked out I will have earned £450 by the end of the trip. 

Super happy! I funded the entire trip and earned a profit whilst having a wonderful, relaxing time in another country and working 20 to 25 hours in total. 

I can't wait to take this to the next level, budgeting better and building up my clients. 

This has been a dream of mine for many years and I feel like I can comfortably say that it is now within my grasp :)

Throughout the pandemic I have taken several road trips and been able to work remotely during that time, but none of those trips have been longer than 10 days or so, and they've all been domestic, within the U.S. However, now that I am fully vaccinated and starting to feel more comfortable with air travel, I am curious about taking some longer trips both locally and abroad in the next year or so.    


As I've been researching, I've been reading a lot about the various countries that have been announcing new digital nomad visas to attract remote workers. However, I wanted to come here and ask what your experience has been with these visas? I don't know that I would necessarily jump straight into being on the road full time, most likely I'd try to travel for a month or two at a time and then return to my home in the DC area. Would you say that sticking with a tourist visa is good enough for this sort of travel? From what I understand, as long as my company is not based out of the country I am visiting, then there is no issue with working on a tourist visa. Is this accurate? Are there any advantages to a digital nomad visa over a tourist visa when traveling for a period of under 3 months?

I am a US citizen and have ALWAYS wanted to live in Japan. The only issue is that the work culture there is terrible: they have a terrible work/life balance and you can get paid more by doing less in another country. The only way I could see myself moving there is if I work for an American company and get paid an American salary, but I'm allowed to be based in Japan. 

Now, the company I work for is US based, but they are slowly opening offices in other countries. They haven't mentioned anything about Japan, but we have a big market there and a couple employees based in Japan, so I think a Japan office could be something that could happen in the next few years. If not, the company seems to be increasingly flexible with working hours and would let employees work from anywhere in the world. 

Now, I just moved so I wouldn't make the big move to Japan for at least 3/4 years (or whenever the pandemic ends, ugh). That being said, has anyone been in my situation before, or does anyone have tips on how to best prepare for a move to Japan?

We actually got tear gassed at Istanbul Pride in June, which the government officially banned but which we went to in order to show our support for Turkey's LGBTQI community. (I wrote about the experience here: [https://brentandmichaelaregoingplaces.substack.com/...](https://brentandmichaelaregoingplaces.substack.com/p/istanbul-pride-i-can-now-check-getting?fbclid=IwAR0y8jGPQgcw9_ughISXmuzlXkBM76wtstoDPWR66O8XxqrWap2tJ3BenvA))

So no need to yell at me about the bad part of Turkey. :-) 

There's an entire discussion to be had about visiting countries like Turkey, but I figure that's a different post. This is just intended to be my thoughts about Istanbul as a digital nomad destination. 

Here we go. 

1) Cost

We found Istanbul to be crazy affordable but keep in mind we were there right as travel to Europe was starting to open back up. In fact, Turkey was one of the first places Americans could go. (Not sure about other nationalities.)

Our apartment in the very trendy Beyoglu neighborhood cost us $650. It wasn't the greatest apartment -- no kitchen, just a hotplate -- but the location couldn't have been better. We were about a thirty second walk from Istiklal Avenue, one of the most interesting spots in all of Istanbul. 

Everything else was very cheap as well. We could have a pretty darned nice meal out for about $12 USD and could eat considerably cheaper for much less. A soy latte which would cost me about $6 in the US cost me half of that in Istanbul. 

Other things like clothing, groceries, eye glasses, dental care, etc. were also very affordable. I imagine housing costs have probably gone up some as travel resumes but I can't imagine Istanbul becoming expensive any time soon. 

2) Covid

Our last few weeks in Istanbul the official lockdowns started to ease and more places began opening up. Currently, 60% of Turks are fully vaccinated and 75% have had at least one jab. 

Mask usage was initially pretty good but then declined as the government eased up. Apparently, mask requirements are returning but it sounds like a lot of folks are ignoring them and restaurants aren't really following restrictions either. Cases are rising due to the Delta variant but numbers are way below what they were. 

3) Coworking/Wi Fi

Unfortunately, when we arrived in Istanbul there were still pretty strict lockdowns in place. So I never had a chance to check out coworking. 

The good news is that Istanbul has an AMAZING coffee/coffee house culture. Just within a few minutes walk of our apartment were a dozen different coffee shops with great Wifi and where I did most of my work. In fact, I made it a goal to visit as many of them as I could in order to find my very favorite: 

4) Safety

Despite being a massive metropolis of twenty million people we never felt the least bit unsafe in Istanbul. And that included one night when I went hunting for a pharmacy that took me through a neighborhood that many Americans (myself of four years ago included) would immediately feel was unsafe. Now I know better and that poor folks have way more to fear from rich people. 

I was often out late at night taking pictures and the worst that ever happened was guys trying to get me to come to a bar or a restaurant where I am sure they got a cut of whatever I spent. Naturally, I would never go anywhere in any country with a stranger that walked up to me and started chatting. At no time did anyone try to pickpocket me or harass me in any other way. 

Obviously, I can't speak to how women would feel safety-wise but I will share that when I posted about this topic elsewhere one man chimed in and said his wife used to go out in the evenings on her own and never had a problem. 

5) Visa

Americans get a ninety day visa but it isn't a visa on arrival. I had to apply ahead of time but got it with very little difficulty. I can't speak to Covid requirements in Turkey as of now but back in May we did have to fill out several documents, though it was only while transiting Amsterdam that they were checked. 

We did have to have a HES code (a QR code)  in order to check into our hotel. Restaurants, stores, etc. were supposed to verify customers had them but the only time I saw this enforced was by Starbucks. 

6) Transportation

The central neighborhoods of Istanbul where most nomads are likely to stay have fantastic public transportation options. Did you know Istanbul has the second oldest subway line in the world? 

The metro was fast, efficient, and affordable, as were the trams and ferries. Istanbul has also two very large airports so there are plenty of flights to choose from. 

7) English speaking, medical care, stuff to see

The number of English speakers is fairly low, though at places like coffee shops, restaurants, or really famous tourist spots folks are usually able to answer basic questions. 

And Turkey has a pretty great medical system. In fact, medical tourism is huge here. Let's just say I saw a lot of folks recovering from nose jobs and hair transplants.

And the history is incredible. Istanbul sits at the crossroads between Asia and Europe and Greeks, Romans, Mongols and many more made this city incredibly important. Between the palaces, mosques, towers, museums, and so much more there is plenty to see. 

8) Miscellaneous 

I guess I will touch on the political just a bit to note that while I never felt unsafe because of criminals I often did feel uneasy in Beyoglu, our neighborhood, and nearby Taksim Square because of a massive police presence. That's because those neighborhoods are the heart of secular Turkey and where previous protests against Turkey's increasingly authoritarian regime have taken place. In fact, we got tear gassed a second time during a protest over Turkey's withdrawal from a treaty protecting women. 

Clearly the government is ready to crackdown on any unrest. Seeing the police patrolling the streets with machine guns at the ready got pretty unsettling over time. 

In a nutshell, I loved our time in Istanbul. It's one of the most fascinating, vibrant cities I've ever experienced. And the history (and stray cats) are amazing. But at the end of two months I confess I couldn't wait to get out because of the political and religious oppression.

Okay, this post got away from me. Hope I didn't bore anyone! 

Happy to answer any questions for folks that have them."
prtm1j,dyuu4iu5,"Airbnb sucks, here's what I do instead","Airbnb is sort of a DN standard, but I mentioned in a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/pm98c1/psa_for_those_considering_taking_their_remote_job/hcg5311?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) recently how my husband and I DN without Airbnb. I used Airbnb faithfully for many years, but pretty much every benefit from the site has been ruined by their awful customer service, massive fees, and rampant scams. I'm done paying for nothing and only getting 1/10th of my money back, or showing up in a foreign country just to find out that my gorgeous Airbnb is actually just a blow-up mattress in some alcoholic's living room, or the other hellish experiences I've dealt with. More often than not I'm paying 3-4x what I used to, and walking out the minute I get there for whatever dumbfuck reason.

So now my husband and I take a different approach and I'm happy to share it here. As a precursor, my husband and I are slowmads. We spend about 6 months in each country or more. This post is probably less useful for those who are moving to a different country every week or even month. Also, if you just love Airbnb, cool! I don't, and this is for the people who are literally over their bullshit, and how to live this lifestyle while circumventing them. This is also a US-centric post because I'm from the US, but I'd love to hear the perspective from other countries.

One thing I've learned in the last year is that the way we handle rentals in the United States is not the norm for the rest of the world. We have very strict, legal rental processes that are fairly streamlined throughout the US, and tend to lock the renter into a long lease with high upfront costs. This has not been my experience throughout Asia, Africa, and even some parts of Europe. The rental system is a lot more fluid, and more open to shorter-term rentals, like one month, three months, six months, etc. This will not be true everywhere, but finding a monthly rental in the United States that isn't just a traphouse is very difficult, but **it is not that difficult outside of the United States.**

The other great thing is, furnished rentals are a lot more common outside of the United States, and don't carry the premium cost of United States rentals. I was renting for over 10 years in the United States, and I never actually had a furnished place. They seem to be more of a luxury, where is there a lot more standardized in other countries.

**So here's how we do it:**

**Step 1: Look up expat groups on Facebook**

Most cities these days will either have an expat group within the actual city itself, or a nearby hub. For example, I am in Kénitra, Morocco right now, the closest expat group is in Rabat, which is about 45 minutes away. But it's a big enough of a hub that I've been able to find resources within my city in that group.

Often these groups are a mixture of locals who speak English and other expats from various countries. I've noticed that the standard tends to be English, but this isn't always the case. Start asking around, or searching the group for rental listings. Asking, ""does anyone know of a place for rent?"" will likely get you some responses.

I find that this is my first go-to because I tend to trust the credibility of other expats. They are often friendly, helpful, and can vouch for someone trustworthy. They may know somebody who knows somebody, have seen ""for rent"" signs, or know of a good jumping-off point.

An alternative that I haven't done as much is checking out the local subreddit for whatever country you're going to. This is a little bit sketchier as it's anonymous, but it could be a good way to get info or to be pointed in the right direction for rentals.

**Step 2: Check Facebook Marketplace**

A ton of rentals around the world are just chilling on Facebook Marketplace. In my experience, it's become a pretty ubiquitous resource for a lot of things. I've found external monitors, adapters I needed to replace, and other miscellaneous things on there, including housing.

Often the listing will have the price right on there and you can ask if they do month-to-month rentals. I like this because sometimes the cost will be inflated if they know you're a foreigner (I don't blame them, but I'm also not trying to spend more if I don't have to). Google Translate is a little bit awkward, but I found it works just fine for short business conversations, and my husband and I are fortunate that we speak about 5 languages between us which helps. If you find somebody that happens to speak whatever language you speak, even better, but I don't think this is necessary with the technology that we have.

Some places may want a contract to be signed or a deposit, but this tends to be pretty low-key. For example, the apartment we're in right now, we did sign a contract but it's month to month, and our deposit was 3000 MAD (or about $330 USD) and it's a really nice place in the center of the city. We've had rentals with no deposit nor contract whatsoever, with no problems at all.

**Step 3: Search for the regional equivalent of craigslist**

Most areas will have some version of craigslist, if not actually craigslist itself. Some places outside of the United States use craigslist, but I found it to be pretty rare. However, each country or region will have its own variation of it. For example, here in Morocco they use [avito.ma](https://avito.ma) which has an app and a website.

Often a quick Google search will help you find this, or the expat groups. Search ""houses for rent \[insert your city/country\]"" or some variation.

**Things to keep in mind**

* The first thing we tend to do when we get the keys is change the locks. It's a small upfront cost, but my husband is pretty handy and we like to be the only ones with access to the property. We change the locks back after we finish our rental, but we've never had any complaints and we always leave it in as good a condition as we found it. Depending on the quality of your rental, this may not be necessary and we've always let the owner know we were doing this (it's pretty common out of the states).
* Yes, you may be missing out on the security of Airbnb, but is it really that secure anymore? I know dozens and dozens of people who have been left absolutely fucked by whatever rental they had put up money for, only to be screwed over by the owner of the property and then completely stonewalled by Airbnb. I'd rather take a risk on a recommendation from a fellow expat for a cheaper place than trust Airbnb anymore.
* **Remember, people want money for their property.** Every minute that they aren't renting, they're losing money on their investment. They may prefer a longer-term rental, but knowing they'll have a couple of months of secure rent for somebody who doesn't have a ton of stuff or children is pretty ideal. You may be even able to negotiate the price down like we've done at every rental we've found. The apartment we're in now was listed at 3400 MAD but we talked them down to 2800 MAD for a secure 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom secured building with a garage and roof access, as well as other cool features.
* For whatever reason, a lot of rental listings are still not online, both in the United States and outside of it. When we struggled to find a listing online, we have occasionally booked short-term rentals through hotels and hostels in the place we wanted to go, and then once we got there we walked around looking for ""for rent"" signs, asking around, looking more ""on the ground"".
* This method of renting apartments and houses has been great for us in terms of quality of life. When you are at an Airbnb, you're sort of stuck with ""whatever they have"", meaning questionable Internet and other amenities. When you're renting a place, you can get fiber-optic installed (with permission), you can hire a housekeeper, you can stock the fridge with whatever you want. I find it saves a lot more money over indefinitely living in someone else's space.
* I've heard of people contacting Airbnb hosts and offering to go off-site with their listings and paying them directly. The guest pays less in fees, the host doesn't lose a bunch in fees, etc. I have never done this, it's probably against the TOS, but if you do it I won't tell anyone.

I'd love to hear how y'all manage and to hear different perspectives on housing from the community :) Also, I ended up [linking](https://crossculturelove.com/airbnb-alternative/) this on my own site so hopefully people can use it as a resource and not just some buried thread in the future."

I'm travelling for a year going from country to country, and do not expect to be back in Canada except for maybe Christmas depending on the situation. I have heard of World Nomad and Manulife.

Heading back to the U.K. in a couple months and feeling sort of terrified for the re-entry process. Although 2 years isn’t a lifetime by any stretch, being away during the pandemic has made me feel even farther from ‘home’.

I’m already planning multiple trips for next year, as some sort of coping mechanism. But I know my friends and family expect me to stick around for a bit.
It’s not like Canada is a million miles from the U.K. in terms of culture, but it’s almost as though I’ve gotten hooked on the feeling of being elsewhere. The reason I left home to pursue this lifestyle was because I felt too comfortable - bored and unchallenged. At times I feel pulled between needing constant change and stimulation, but at the same time a little comfort and stability wouldn’t hurt - it does get lonely sometimes. I’ve spent the last 2 years not being sure where I could be each month to the next. I’m 25 so I am still really young, but I see so many of my peers back home getting engaged/having children and just, it’s not really a community I’m that thrilled to be going back to. I love my friends but I feel as though I’ve changed so much and nothing will have really changed back home. It’s feels a bit isolating.

pt3mew,oudxz,Noobie nomad/Greece," I am just getting started being a digital nomad, and I have some questions.  
I will be staying in Greece for a few months and was wondering if any of you know some good places to stay there. My friend, who I am traveling with wants to go to Athen, any of you who've experienced this? I was thinking more like a ""paradise-ish"" place with a beautiful beach but as a noobie nomad, I don't know what we should be looking for.  
Also, should we use other apps than Airbnb to find places to stay?  
Hope someone can help :D"
pt4ni4,epaz5mky,Colombia VS Guatemala?,"Hi everyone!
I'm planning on going to Central/South America in October but can't really put my finger on a location.
I'm a Video Editor, therefore I need a strong and stable internet connection (Preferably at least 25-50MB, from Wifi or Sim card hot spot).
The two countries that interest me are Colombia or Guatemala and I wanted to know if any of you who have been there, or are there right now, can shed some light on the situation?
Which has better internet connection? Better access to nature? Which is cheaper? Which has less covid restrictions? And in general any suggestions about these countries will be appreciated :)
Overall all I'm totally open to suggestions for other central/south American countries which has great connection, great nature, great prices and great vibes! ;) Gracias Amigos!"

pt7ik3,148l9l,Unexciting but warm winter destination for Finnish remote worker?,"Hi,

I'm perhaps not a typical digital nomad, as I have a full-time job that I intend to keep. There is a very high chance that I will be allowed to work from a foreign country at least for a couple of months if I ask (my coworkers have done so without issue).

My reason for trying this is that I hate the cold. Other than the climate, I love living in Helsinki. So, I'm looking for a place where everything just works, human interaction can be minimized (I realize I have to be a bit flexible with these first two, since I suspect nowhere warm beats Finland in that regard), and it's possible to run, cycle (both preferably from your front door) and eat healthy (easily and getting stuff from like a supermarket or takeaway place, I have no desire to walk around markets looking for produce). Not looking for the cheapest location possible, but not any sort of luxury resort either. Within the EU would be great for bureaucratic reasons.

It doesn't have to be super hot, but not a crazy amount of rain and at least 15C most days around December-February would be nice. Over 30 is getting a bit too warm for me.

Right now I'm looking at Portugal (Algarve or around Lisbon) or the Canary Islands (I don't really mind things being touristy). I've been on a couple of vacations in those places. Any comments or other ideas?"

This will be mostly fine and doable for me, but I've been reading that while some consulates have switched to using a more relaxed income measure (UMA) that would only require me to prove about USD$1400 of monthly income for the previous 6 months, some still use a calculation based on minimum salary which is significantly higher (around USD$2200/mo). Before I go emailing all of the different consulates that are cheap to fly to from CDMX to see which of them use which measure, does anyone happen to have recent knowledge of this? Even if you know of just one nearby consulate, any info is helpful! thanks a mil x"

ptpxxj,cdxwn0i3,Who here has a home base?,"I was wondering - How many of you aren't full-time nomads, but have a home base somewhere, where they spend at least a few months a year? If you do, where is your home base, how much time do you spend there and what do you do with it when you're traveling?

I haven't had a home base in years and start craving to have one. It would be nice to have a place somewhere to come back to, and maybe spend at least 3 out of 12 months. Not sure though what I would do with it the rest of the year. I guess if I own it it's fine, but paying rent and not being there... nah."
pts20b,2ati14wn,Should I trust the lockers at the Selina in Lisbon with my MacBook?,"This is my first time staying at a Selina instead of an airbnb and would love to learn if anyone has encountered issues of things being stolen from the lockers. 

I will of course buy a good lock but I'm planning to do some weekend trips here and there and would like to leave my electronics behind. 
I get that Selina is not a regular hostel but one in which almost everyone will carry a laptop with them anyhow, so perhaps less of an issue with laptops standing out too much and being stolen? but have you been ok leaving valuables behind for more than a day? 

What's your experience and what would you recommend? Looks like my only two option are the lockers and leaving things at the front desk.

I have a 1 hour layover in poland though, and my friend told me that it because of that, I WOULD need to quarantine for like 2 weeks.

ptuczq,7yf1ju0p,I've overstayed my tourist visa in an Eastern European country. Will the US embassy hold this against me in getting my passport renewed here?,"I’m in a bit of a pickle, I’m an American who fell madly and deeply in love with a Bulgarian girl here, we married and I have over-stayed my tourist VISA by several years - don't regret it one bit! We were going to travel in early 2020 and apply for my Bulgarian VISA-D elsewhere but then world went mad and our travel plans where postponed.  
My passport is expiring in early 2022, so I need to get my passport renewed here at the American Embassy.

I cannot travel to the US to renew it because we love each other very much and refuse to be separated (I do believe it’s my formally protected human right to not be separated from my spouse) and I doubt my wife will be granted a US tourist VISA as we refuse to take the COVID vaccine (religious exemption - we won’t be convinced to take it).

My big question is, **will my having overstayed my tourist VISA be a problem for getting my passport renewed?**  
*Does the American Embassy care if I’m a tourist VISA overstayer/“undocumented"" expat here?*  
*Will they report me as a tourist VISA overstayer to the Bulgarian authorities?*

I’m hoping that they have bigger things to worry about. Other than overstaying my tourist VISA, I’ve been a model, law-abiding guest in this country. I sincerely appreciate anybody who might have any insight as to whether my overstay might be a challenge in getting a new passport here!"

ptygts,17cuwm,Questioning the legality of all of this,"Isn't it technically illegal in most countries to work in the country on a tourist visa?  


I'm not a lawyer, but I would think that the purposes of such laws are so you aren't visiting the country and taking jobs of locals. Not because you're physically working in that country for a position in the US. Could anyone shed some light on this for me? It feels like a technicality, which could be why I haven't heard about it until recently."

pujia5,dkfzzbm9,Universal travel adapter,"What do you think about a Universal travel adapter? Would need or no? Why or why not?

This is my go anywhere onebag for my future traveling the world. Longer travel times since that is how you'd get a feel for the culture. Would like to know if am missing anything, or anything that should be considered?

**Key items**

* Laptop
* Amazon fire tablet
* Phone
   * Powerbank
   * 1 usb-c charger
   * 1 micro usb charger
* Universal travel adapter ?
* Wireless Headphones
* Camera
   * edit: Oh I totally forgot about the camera. It's a small compact good camera better than the so-so quality on mobile pretty much
* Something to hold these
   * Passport - would you need copies of passport, don't think that would be helpful since they always want originals, and not copies
   * 1 bank card
   * Haven't decided yet on what to get to hold these, or if should put them in seperate places. Please recommend specific ideas if you have good ones

**Bath**

* Electric toothbrush
* Extra toothbrush heads - there's so small and take up so little space, it's fine
* Nail clip
* Bath towel (may go for fast drying towel, but don't think it's needed)
* edit: 1 electric  razor-shaving stuff (completely forgot about this also)

&#x200B;

**Clothes**

* 1 good jacket [https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-insulated-jacket/](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-insulated-jacket/)
   * Have not decided on a good coat. If you have good ideas, please recommend
* 2-4 shirts
* 2 pants
* 2 pairs of socks
* 1 shoe
* 1-2 sunglasses
* No need for underwears, undies not real psst
* Few masks
* Sun hat (big wide)
* edit: pillow pillow, pillow, Travel pillow for transit - I don't know and don't think they make any good travel pillows yet. I looked into this once before and I couldn't find anything, this would seem like it'd be worth the cost (in space and cost) if they made a really good one

I'm not not fully decided on if anything on this packlist needs packing cubes. It seems unlikely

&#x200B;

**Best OneBag**

* Small compact umbrella
* Or a ""waterproof onebag""

I haven't decided on what's the best onebag yet that would fit all these - [https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-carry-on-travel-bags/](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-carry-on-travel-bags/)

If you have good ideas, please recommend. I want to make final the packlist first before making final the onebag bag. But this seems to be pretty close near to final. But good ideas welcomed

A small compact umbrella seems better than a super waterproof bag. Won't want to go out under heavy rain anyway.  So likely just going to go with a small compact umbrella. It's much more versatile anyway.

&#x200B;

**Rest of things would buy at location**

* Toothpaste
* Liquid Soap
* Water Filter
* Toliet paper
* Plastic fork/spoon etc
* &#x200B;

Can't think of anything else right now

This is my minimalistic go anywhere when there isn't any extreme weather

Not really sure if there's any really good onebag travel the world packlist out there

Minor notes:

* A few mentioned Ibuprofen. So far don't think going to bring Ibuprofen, drugs don't seem worth it

puomjl,kmbjg,Best International Phone Plans for Keeping U.S. Number?,"Hi all,

Basically what the title says. I've been going down the rabbit hole trying to figure out the best plan for international travel. In the past I've done Google voice + local sims but have found it to be fiddly (had issues getting 2FA codes and found the voice app to be... quirky).

I switched over to Google Fi today in anticipation of a 2-3 month trip to Europe, but just found out that they will cancel service if you're abroad for 3+ months without bouncing back to the U.S. for a significant portion of time. So, it seems like that plan isn't going to work for me. I'll use Fi for this trip, but need to figure something else out as I plan to be overseas for most of 2022 onwards.

All of the U.S.-based carriers' international plans seem very expensive and coverage is hit or miss in terms of countries covered. What are my options here? I need to be able to maintain my US number for business calls - and would like it to be reliable since I need to be on-call most of the time for when issues arise. What have y'all found that works well? I'll likely be mostly traveling around LATAM, if that makes a difference."

As you guys know, finding a company that allows (or doesn't inquire about) flexible travel arrangements is a big issue. My work environment is really flexible which allows me to work mostly on my own time, another perk mot companies don't have. This makes me wonder if trying to target a senior position paying in the 150 - 180k range in a couple years is worth it.

puyxy5,cyduk,Let's talk networking,"Opsie, I forgot to post this a few days ago.

My first post was [Universal plug shape adapters](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/poozix/universal_plug_shape_adapters/), then I had a brief rundown of [USB C chargers](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/pqj202/lets_talk_usb_c_chargers/) and now I want to talk about networking.

There is only one router to be considered as far as I am concerned. (Most of the time the real variety in these areas are extremely low, everyone sells the same crap with insignificant variations.) Here are the criteria:

1. Power via standard USB, micro or C. No custom bricks (brr!), no USB to barrel custom cables, too hard to replace when -- and not if -- lost.
1. It needs to have at least two RJ45. One for WAN, one for LAN.
1. Dual band. How is 2.4GHz only still a thing.
1. It must run open source firmware both for security and features.

As far as I know, the [GL.iNet Creta](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-ar750/) aka GL-AR750 alone fits these four simple criteria. OK, I lied: there are two, because the GL-AR750S is also good, some might want the external antenna.

Why these? The first three already are tough. However, there is some selection, for example the incredible small Elecom WRH-583BK2-S at only 43g. But it doesn't have enough memory for OpenWRT so alas it's out. The GL-AR750 is 67g so I am not going to sweat it.

These days, most laptops don't come with Ethernet ports any more. Add one with the Belkin USB-C to Ethernet Adapter + Charge (INC001btBK) / Delock 65402 / whatever else label it is sold under if your device can charge from 60W or less. If you want a solution without a pigtail and charging is not needed, my recommendation is the Tripp Lite USB C to Gigabit Ethernet Network Adapter Vertical M/F USB-C 3.1 (U436-000-GB) because of the rotation, it doesn't block neighbouring ports. Our cabling of choice is the Monoprice Micro SlimRun, I don't think it's even possible to make a lighter weight Ethernet cable. The entire pile of this paragraph is less than 40g. https://i.imgur.com/LND6bkq.jpg  Note Android since Android 11 can Ethernet tether, so I use this pile when I need to tether for a prolonged time. The phone doesn't get as hot as it does with wifi tethering and the connection is better since it's wired.

Ps.: there is very recent progress https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2242.html is very promising however https://youtu.be/w7teLVwi408?t=780 says the wifi is only 60mbit/s even in the best case. Still, with a nicer enclosure this might be the ticket due to the small size and the massively capable platform. Then again, the price is brutal as you need a RasPi CM4 module besides this carrier board."
puzrdi,592h2jd0,"Implications for an employer that allows ""short term"" remote work from outside home country","I read a very interesting discussion about the legitimacy of nomadic work, whether is legal or just a grey area.

I wanted to learn from those that have a job (work for a company big or small) and have requested to work outside their home country at least for a small period (2 to 4 weeks). My previous employer did not allowed this (hence why it is previous lol), and there was never a justification, at times it felt oppressing and unfair. All they said was a bold ""YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO WORK OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY YOU ARE CONTRACTED FOR, PERIOD""

I want to learn more about the real reasons why an employer will not allow this. The reasons I've discovered so far are:

\- Tax

\- GDPR or California Act (for US)

\- Data

\- Right to work in the foreign country

\- Insurance

How is it possible that self-employed people can overcome all the above and huge corporates or respectable companies can't? Is ""not allowing people to work abroad for a short while"" a way to micro-manage or there are real issues behind.

I just can't work it out. Why is it so difficult for some employers to allow their employees to have some sort of freedom? The world seems to opening to this idea, but I feel that there is some dark force behind not giving in..."

I have recent European heritage; hence, I could quickly become an EU national. A sibling of mine already is.

Also, yes, I am learning multiple languages already. Some people told me to live in London for a bit then move to mainland Europe.

I'm a single young man with wealth; **I am only looking for friends and dating opportunities.**

I wonder where you would guys recommend me."

pvqlpc,8lls8j2h,Work from Anywhere: offer from a German company --> live somewhere else,"Hello, I have a novice question regarding the topic of working for an established company but living elsewhere.

So I finally got an offer from a German company that offers the benefit of working from anywhere. I am not an EU citizen, but am residing in Germany at the moment. 

I am thinking of living somewhere else that is cheaper and closer to my family than here for a few months or even a year (i.e. Colombia), while working for the German company. This company does not have subsidiaries in other countries, so I will essentially be on my own at home. 

My question is, if this company offers this work from anywhere benefit, what are the tax implications for me, and is it really possible? If I reside in my home country for more than 183 days, I assume I will have to pay taxes in my home country, but do I have to pay taxes in Germany as well?

I read somewhere that the company would need to establish a branch or something like that in my home country to be able to hire me as an employee, otherwise I would need to establish myself as a contractor. Does this still apply nowadays?

pwfluz,yd3l2uv,"List of Digital Nomad Visa, Long Stay Options, and Visa Hacks Rated","I got a little frustrated with sites listing ""DN visas"" and all them being in the Caribbean with a $2k fee and $70k minimum income, so I did some research and organized the visa list below.

This is a full list of every *reasonable* visa option I could find for digital nomads (and a few unreasonable ones), rated it by practicality (1-5) on ease of getting the visa, fees, desirability of the location, cost of living, and how the location generally resonates with DNs and there needs.

There were 45 visa options I could find 6+ month visas or good short term visa situations, with about 13 being all around reasonable DN visas, 4 good visa hacks or worthwhile short term visas, and 6 DN programs with legislation being passed by countries and potential long stay/DN/Remote Worker Visas.

This is the TLDR version.

The full list is [here](https://abrotherabroad.com/digital-nomad-visa-remote-worker-visa/) with an obsessive amount of detail and links to official information sites, applications, cost of living, internet speeds and all of the extra details that are too much for this post.  Also, I'll keep that updated with news on the 6 new DN visas in progress

After a lot of staring at immigration websites, here are the best visas for each region

**Best in the EU:** Estonia (1 year)

**Best European, Non-Schengen:** Croatia (1 year) & Georgia (1 year)

**Best in SEA:** Vietnam (1 year for US citizens, 6 months for non-US) and Taiwan (3 years)

**Best in South America:** Argentina with border runs to Uruguay or Chile every 90 days

**Best in Central America+Mexico:** Mexico (1 year convertible to permanent residency) or Costa Rica (2 years convertible to permanent residency)

**Best Hack:** All Balkans countries offer 90 days and are close enough for border runs, Albania offers 1 year

**Surprises:** Indonesia/Bali added a ""proof of $10,000 in your bank account) requirement for the 5 month visa (B211)

px4lf1,77ztgz20,"Advice on renting out property, aiming for DN demographic","Hi there, first post ever on Reddit here. I´m on the verge of purchasing a large flat on a gated community with a sizable swimming pool close to the beach in eastern Spain. 3 Bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a larger one with a bathtub and a smaller one with a shower. The idea is to rent the apartment seasonally, or renting out one of the rooms (with 2 beds) and one of the bathrooms as a pack during the off season, ideally to DNs, with all the amenities a DN might need, while keeping the other 2 rooms and the smaller bathroom for my personal use. Of course guests would also have access to common areas like the kitchen, living room, or balcony. I may or may not be there during rentals. I don´t necessarily want to go the Airbnb/booking.com route yet. 

&#x200B;

As DNs, do you see this arrangement as working or feasible? Any input is welcome. Also are there any websites catering mainly to the DN demographic where I could announce my flat to any interested parties? I like Vrbo so far. I tried other sites, but apparently you need the flat to be in a large city in order for the site to allow you to post your place there, and other sites like ""All the rooms"" seem to be rather US centric.

pxapk5,2e0k7o8n,Seeking Advice For A New Lifestyle,"Hello everyone,

I’m looking for advice because I get no fulfillment or validation in my current life right now. To be clear, I love life and myself (usually) and try to connect with nature and spirituality whenever I can. I just hate this mundane existence we’ve been force fed to believe is our best life. Waking up everyday, following the same routine, going to work for some company that doesn’t give a fuck about you, go home and have a few hours to yourself, rinse and repeat. I’m not buying it. I go through everyday just feeling like my spirit is broken. 


Quick background for perspective. Im a 31 year old male. I had goals in my 20s of finding a partner and getting married, buying a house and having a dog, getting a motorcycle, climbing my way through the corporate ladder and making 6 figures. I achieved every single one of those goals at 27… and was the most miserable I’d been in my entire life. This was due to finally processing past trauma. But I learned the job/money/material goals were bullshit. They didn’t truly fulfill me. Then, one day I came home and found my fiancé dead 6 months before our wedding. It’s been 2.5 years and Im still trying to figure out what path I want to go down now. I have another respectable decent paying management job, but I absolutely hate it. 

Everyday I daydream about being somewhere else. I’ve been watching a lot of van life and van build videos and would 100% do that if I could find a remote job that I could do while living out of my van. I love road trips and all my free time is spent driving around aimlessly trying to find random cool shit. Any vacation I plan is always driving somewhere and hitting up state or national parks or weird obscure places. I love nature and national parks so van life seems like something I’d really enjoy. I also love home design and would love to work for myself flipping houses but I don’t have the capital for it. I also think I’d like being a therapist because I’m generally great and listening to people and offering helpful words on top of all of the reading I have done to try and heal myself after everything that’s happened. 

I guess I’m just venting, asking for help, and asking for advice from anyone who knows what a good work from home option would be, or good remote positions I can look into that I can do the van life for a while and also save money so when I decide it’s time to settle down again, I can get another place. Thanks for reading this far and all help is appreciated!"
pxb8n6,3oc29l0a,Question- Switching From Employee To Freelancer,"Hi Guys,

My employer in Canada agreed to hire me as a contractor so that I can work remotely from Germany. Their offer was to pay me my usual monthly wage (without tax deductions), as long as I worked approx. 40 hours a week and got the work done. When we talked about vacation and sick days they said that since I am no longer an employee, it would be more flexible and I can take days as and when needed but I would still receive the regular monthly wage.

Shortly after agreeing, I had the thought that I should have negotiated for a higher wage since I won't get employee benefits such as pension contributions, health insurance and employment insurance. I recently mentioned to them that I'd like to discuss my wage because of this and their argument is that they assumed I would be better off due to tax write-offs. 

When I do the math, my take-home salary will remain nearly the same even with health insurance etc taken into account. So, should I still ask for a higher wage? I keep reading about freelancers earning 1.5-2 times what regular employees earn but I don't know how I can justify that when negotiating.

Thanks!"

pxc0wd,ardup,Nervous about taking the plunge - how did manage to start?,"My wife and I have been talking about living on the road for 6 months out of the year, ideally starting in 2022. Our work allows this to happen pretty much wherever there's WIFI.

But we're stuck on two levels:

1. Letting go of our possessions (furniture, photo albums, wardrobe we wouldn't want to drag around the world).
2. Letting go of our rent-controlled townhouse (been in the same spot for 15 years and pay a fraction of what our neighbors pay)

So for the first part, I'd like psychological advice here. I know we could just get rid of everything and keep the basics in a storage locker somewhere and be happy. That would be fine, but if you have tips on dealing with the emotional fallout I'm definitely all ears because it's a bitter pill to kind of feel like you've ""lost everything"".

The second half is way way tougher: what do we do when we get back if we don't have a home base to return to? Should we be thinking about this as more than a 6 month commitment? Or should we be looking at maybe just moving back to a cheaper city altogether?

Any tips, stories, or memories of how you got started are definitely welcome."

So, I'm looking for some advice on what the best pay-as-go US service is for traveling international. Here's some things that i'm thinking about:

* I literally only need the US number to receive occasional 2FA sms text messages outside the US
* Dont need data
* Pre-paid is ok, but since there will be long stretches i dont use the service, I dont want to have to worry about the carrier canceling it (i had t-mobile's pre-paid service for awhile, but they cancelled it on me for not using it for 3 months)
* Obvs has to work internationally
* I've looked into Google Fi, which seems rad, cuz you can put the service on hold, but it's still like $20/month and data seems to be its strong point.
* Definitely not looking to pay more than $5-10/month for this

pxrri4,odt7a,Please help me decide between Mexico and Thailand,"Both available to me and fully aware of visa options and length of stay, etc.

I need to work UK hours so obviously Thailand works more in my favour, could start at around 2pm and finish at 10pm-ish versus a 4am start in Mexico (which would have its benefits later in the day, however).

Thailand:
*Could start any time from 2pm - 4pm, finish between 10pm - midnight.
*Would be free a lot of the day and easier to travel and set up base elsewhere without taking PTO from work - just travel in the morning and work as usual later on
*MUCH cheaper for quality accommodation like a condo with pool and gym

-Can't stay as long as in Mexico, currently only 60-90 days possible and can't go to a nearby country at the moment to do a visa run

Mexico:
*Would be based in Mexico City, plenty to see and do and lots of foreigners to befriend
*Have a good friend there already
*Great food, cheap
*Could nap in early afternoon to catch up on sleep and have a lot of free time in the evenings

-Shitty working times as I am not sure how realistic it would be to get up at 4am to work
-Accommodation generally quite shitty unless you're prepared to pay western prices, way more expensive than Thailand

py5oz1,6se99,Here's my story as a Digital Nomad for anyone interested,"I had wanted to be a digital nomad since I knew it was a thing. I learned Spanish and Portuguese in college and was dying to live abroad. As soon as I graduated in 2017 I backpacked Brazil and taught English for shit money. Once I left Brazil I got a shit job in the US as a waiter and learned about websites and marketing so that I could keep teaching Brazilians online.

After I got some students I moved to Colombia for 6 months in 2018 but it was really hard because money was tight, so I switched that company to hire a girl to teach Spanish to Americans. Those 6 months were fun but I was so broke and working all the time and stressed out which made me miss out on a lot of things.

After, I came back to the US in debt and got a job at an ad agency in 2019 and worked there for a year then went remote, still working for them and went back to Brazil and COVID happened 3 months later. I got COVID there and got super sick and came back to the US after and they kept having us work more and more (salaried position) and the day I had to work 15 hours for no overtime I quit.

I couldn't find a job because the economy was shot then right after everything tanked so I started freelancing. I grinded super hard and worked 12 hour days for less than minimum wage for a few months until I got back up to my salary with the agency. I started traveling during the pandemic to Mexico a couple of times and Brazil again (I love Brazil in case you haven't noticed) and now I'm in Europe. 

I'm making 3x more than I was making at the agency now, about $15k/mo. I'm my own boss and I can travel anywhere I want (except for maybe Asia because I would have to take calls, I could try but I think it would kinda suck). Anyway I'm at the point now that I dreamt of when I was 19 or 20 (I'm 26 now) but I feel lost and kind of aimless a lot of the time.

I meditate and journal every day. Essentially I'm saying that I do a lot of self reflection and I still feel lost and not sure of what I want to do with my life.

Workwise I feel burnt out but I see a path to keep making more money and will likely hire an employee when I get back from Europe in a couple of months but making more money doesn't make me any happier, my cost of living is a fraction of what I make and hasn't gone up at all since I started making more money because I don't really want anything plus I'm very aware of the hedonic treadmill and the luxury trap.

So that's my story. AMA? Not sure how this works as I haven't used reddit or been on this sub in a long time."

I’ve been very lucky and have made a lot of money on my business. I get to travel and have all the time in the world. I decide my working hours. I’m happy.

But I miss medicine so much. I miss science. There are days when I wonder if I made the right choice. Sometimes I worry I will always regret not doing something science related.  (Though one trip to Europe solves those worries 😂)

I still like to have a market nearby of course, but I don't want the noise and fuss of being in the center of a big city.

I thought that maybe Alicante or Malaga would be great choices for Spain, but I wanted to hear from people who have lived or are currently living there. What would you guys recommend?

Now I work in EST so my best bet would be to stay somewhere in Mexico for no more then a month (for the first trip at least). From the looks of it, Playa Del Carmen looks like a wonderful place. Checks every box.

Has anyone my age done this? Would being a younger individual hinder a social life? All critics and comments are much appreciated.

q17eqm,4fjcizo4,Health Care is incredibly complicated for American digital nomads. Here is everything we've learned about it over the past four years.,"So here is the newsletter about dealing with health care as digital nomads I mentioned before.

Couple of things:

We did a ton of research but this issue is insanely complicated and we are not experts. Double check for yourself everything we discuss here and ask lots of questions from whomever you buy your insurance.

This is aimed at Americans, since we're Americans and most of the rest of the world is less insane when it comes to health care. That being said, there is information here that could be helpful to everyone.

We also don't tackle health insurance for folks looking to spend a lot of time in one country they are hoping to get residency in. That varies wildly from country to country and is even more complicated.

It's too long to post the whole thing here but here are the main points of what it covers:

The four important concerns of health care for nomads: (1) emergency care, (2) medical evacuation, (3) a regular doctor for overall health issues, and (4) catastrophic coverage back in America.

The six ways you can pay for these different concerns: (1) out-of-pocket, (2) travel insurance, (3) credit card travel insurance, (4) international health insurance, (5) an Obamacare policy, and (6) a generous employer.

How you can combine different kinds of insurance to cover yourself and our recommendations.

Again, we are NOT experts. This is just what we've learned and are happy to share. I hope this is of use to some folks. Feel free to ask any questions and we'll do our best to answer.

q186cz,143qs2,Puerto Morelos in Mexico is a hidden gem for nomads,"Hey guys, I've just recently spent a whole month in Puerto Morelos, Mexico —a town between Cancun and Playa del Carmen— and I'd totally suggest to go check it out.

I even [made a full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHiS-q3JkYs) showing coffee shops and things to do.

So if you wanna know how was Cancun or Playa before they go too popular, this town has that vibe: very mexican, humble style on the Colonia area but it also has a beach zone with tons of food, fun activities and surprisingly good wifi.

What's cool about it?

* Very affordable: you can live well with around 1K budget per month.
* Food: mexican food and international cuisine.
* Beach: just a block away there are tons of things to do, like diving!
* Wifi: some places have fiber optic so you could get fast wifi, but it takes a bit of research.

What's not that good?

* Small DN community: just a few who work online around here.
* Weather: well for some it will be too hot, but I think that's good lol.

I think it will eventually become one of the DN hotspots in Mexico, but in the meantime there are not many DNs. Which is cool. But if you need to hang out with more people, well Playa del Carmen is only 30 mins away by car.

q1v91o,odt7a,Starting DN life next week in Thailand,"Hey DNs! Hope you're well keeping well wherever you may find u yourselves in the world.

After trying for about 3 years to find a remote job I've finally landed one with a video games company that is based out of North America with offices around the globe.

I negotiated a fully remote role with (close to) UK working hours, and will be off to Phuket next week to begin my journey!

Depending on how long I can extend my stay with various visas and covid extensions, etc, I plan to stay in Thailand until any other SE Asian countries open back up, before getting out and about every couple of months.

Working hours are generally going to be middle afternoon until late at night, so around 2.30pm - 11.00pm.

I initially planned to head to Mexico due to having the option to stay 6 months visa-fee, but ultimately chose SE Asia over Mexico because I could not see myself getting up at 3.00am to work to a UK 9.00am starting time.

At this stage I'm not sure if I will take a large suitcase with me or just my smaller (hand luggage sized) one with wheels plus my 80 litre rucksack. I have a fair bit of hardware to take with me, namely 2 laptops, keyboard/mouse, portable monitor, docking station, webcam, headphones, etc. And that's not mentioning my personal items such as phones, drone, batteries, powerbank, chargers, shoes, clothes and medication and toiletries, etc.

I still need to sort out insurance in case I happen to get any of my stuff stolen, but medical insurance is taken care of at least for the first month.

Looking forward to enjoying long weekends of Friday 10pm (can finish work early on Fridays) until Monday at 5.00pm (I'll choose to start work at 10.00am UK time as that's the latest you're allowed to start), and having plenty of time during mornings and early afternoons to travel and not have to take any PTO to change location.

Any tips or anything you feel I may have overlooked at this stage?

Take care!"

q2d4qr,cfy6k,"CA job, resident in TX, want to work from Portgual for 60 days","Not sure if this is the correct sub, please help.. I've been looking online for days, but still confused on this. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Like the title states, my wife and I live in Texas, and work full time for companies in California. We are US citizens. We want to go live and do our jobs from Portugal for approximately 2 months. When I emailed the portugal embassy in DC, they said we dont need visas up to 90 days since we are US citizens.

My question is.... we still have not brought this idea to our employers. Looking online most employers do not like their employees working overseas as it creates tax liabilities. That said, since our visit is less than the 90 days, we wouldn't be considered residents in Portugal and we have a home in Texas and we wouldn't change the addresses. 

Am I overthinking this? Does all tax implications arise if 1) we change the address to a foreign address and/or 2) we stay in one country (in this case Portugal) for more than 90 days?

What type of Visas do you use? - It seems like self employment visas are the most flexible in both countries, but Spain is coming out with a digital nomad visa as well. The stability and pay of remote job over freelancing is enticing but I've heard you get double taxed in Spain.

What kind of job is best? - Right now my options are: freelancing with lower pay, need time to build clients, and the most flexibility. Remote employment with stability, higher pay but double taxation, Germany may not be an option. Or try to make a deal with a company where I'm an independent contractor and try to get the freelance visa (not totally sure if this would work).

Any other general advice? - As a newby, sometimes you don't know what questions to ask. Open to any suggestions"

I currently live in Toronto and work as a Team Lead / Project Manager for a Canadian tech start-up and make $75,000CAD.

I've been applying for 'remote' jobs, but nearly all (both in the US and Canada) require you to work 'remotely' from Canada, which is the opposite of what I'm trying to do.

Given how much I've wanted to have a job where I can work fully remotely, and where I can travel to low-cost cities (Medellin, CDMX, etc.), would it be idiotic to take such a large pay cut / work worse hours than my current, safe 9 - 5 job?

I actually feel really blessed or lucky (I'm not particularly religious) that the timing worked out that I could be with her in her final months and still keep my job.

After she passed, I had to sell her house, but I was able to continue to WFH and close up all the loose ends of my her estate.  

After I sold her house and moved out, my first foray to being a digital nomad was staying with friends for a month in AZ.  Then another month in NorCal.  I accepted my friend's offers to stay with them because since the beginning of Covid, I've been isolated, being caretaker of my mom at first and then grieving her loss. So I really appreciated the companionship as I transitioned into the ""new normal"". 

As for work, I show up to the meetings on time, turn in my work and so far so good.  The fact that the places I stayed at still had the same timezone as the office was really helpful.

But now I'm ready to venture out and take advantage of remote work while it lasts. My company may have us come back to the office in 2022. 

I don't know where to start. It feels like there are many options.  I understand if I go to another timezone, I'll have to adjust my schedule and that's fine. My company is in California and I am using a friend's address near the office, so no worries there.

serious question here...

I follow a bunch of DNs across various platforms – Insta, Twitter, Facebook, Nomadlist, Reddit etc., and I'm always surprised at how much some share about themselves.

Exact location in a city, pictures of their apartments, which co-working they frequent, the tech they carry with them, information on their next flight/destination, what sort of (online) bank they're with etc.

That, combined with posting pics from their birthday, which you can easily use to derive their exact DOB from, and stuff like ""hey, this is kittie, my lovely cat"" and things like ""dude, this is where I grew up!"", which is quite helpful for answering security questions, gives you a solid data set of a person.

Especially since most DNs link from their Twitter to their Insta to their Nomadlist profile, so one can even collect info across all platforms.

**Now, my question**: do you ever worry about being followed/stalked/robbed? Has this ever happened to anyone? Or am I just exaggerating this whole thing?"

q412gq,f1bx4tl8,Landed My First Big Fish Client Today,"Lately I've been seeing a ton of post on Reddit about individuals landing new clients in the SEO industry and if you read my last post you know I'm terrible at sales yet I feel I have a strong grasp of the SEO industry. Now seeing all these post really made me realize that I need to do more selling if I ever want my business to be truly successful and in order to do that I would have to revamp my strategy and somehow leverage my past results to show future clients that what I'm doing really works. 

Skip ahead hundreds of cold calls and unread emails later and it finally happened. I found someone who worked in the service industry and after seeing the results of my last client was interested in hearing more about my SEO services. We jumped on a phone call and concluded with me agreeing to send him a 10 minute video walking him through my process and showing him the current competition level in his area. After receiving the video the client was ecstatic saying he'd worked with other SEO agencies before but nobody had ever shown him a process like this or laid it out so easily for him. It really made me feel good about where my sales process was headed but most of all the client signed on for $1500 a month which for many people here might not seem like a lot but to me this was huge as I'm a one man SEO team. To this day I'm still riding the high of that moment and hopefully the results keep coming to not only me but also you guys as you were the ones who motivated me to really get back into the saddle and sell this thing."

q5cgqn,d48n4zl5,My review of goa(India) for a digital nomad.,"So i'm indian-american, meaning i can understand a bit of the language over there which is hindi. But overall i suck at speaking it, lol. English is what i was brought up with so hindi isn't my fav.

But i went to Goa in early 2019 for around one month and came back here to america (it was just a small trip i'm not an actual digital nomad, lol)

So for my stay, i had an airbnb booked it was around $20 per day/USD. It was an furnished apartment with a 1BR. So i stayed for one month. Meaning the total i payed for a full month was about $600

I needed some clothes, as i didn't bring much clothes because i didn't want to carry much luggage and you get billed more if you do. So i didn't. Instead i went to this mall called ""reliance trends"" and i bought a couple shirts. Each shirt costed me about 200 rupees INR meaning $2.66 USD per shirt. I bought about 20 shirts the total was $53 USD

Next, i wanted food for one month i could've eaten out daily, but as an indian-american who's ate street food/restaurant food there before you don't want to eat out. Reason so is because the water is not reverse osmosis water. Meaning it's not filtered there in general. It'l literally cause a viral infection or diarhea to someone if they drank that (i've seen it from experience, lmao). Plus the food isn't made hygienic either so that's a no.

So don't do that.Instead i went to a local grocery market, and bought a crap ton of chicken and my plan was to freeze it. They sold two pounds of chicken for 80 inr to usd meaning $1.06/USD. I bought 10 pounds of chicken cause i was gonna freeze it and cook it for other stuff such as making butter chicken, or fried chicken etc. so the total was $10.06. I also bought snacks(it's very cheap) and spent 100 usd on snacks.

Regarding the phone, i bought a sim card from jio it was 250 INR and came with 30GB i don't use much data in general. But it worked fine.

EDIT: regarding weather, and wifi speeds etc. The weather was really hot/humid if u stepped out once your face would be sweaty and sticky as soon as you step out your air conditioned place. So everytime i went outside and i'd come back home i'd shower. Also a lot of mosquitoes in general. Mornings when you wake up the whole house, place would have a bunch of dust in general. But if you keep the AC on 24/7 you should be fine. Wifi wise, it wasn't the best it was ok. 

Cafes i wouldn't go to work there, because too many people, noise etc. "

(2) Digital marketing (running Google/Facebook ads, social media marketing, SEO, SEM, PPC)

q5vkzu,rmfst,Level of English you're looking for (Portugal / general),"Hi, I just spent two months in Porto, Portugal, and while everything was amazing, I was really underwhelmed by the level of English there. I was surprised because everyone, including people on this sub, said everyone spoke English and you didn't need Portuguese etc. So I am wondering about the expectations people have (maybe mine are too high). 

What exactly are you looking for in terms of communication in English? 

\-A real conversation, getting to know people? -> 9 times out of 10 impossible in Porto. 

\-Basic directions as in ""Does this bus go to the beach? --- Yes, bus go beach, very nice!"" ""Can I pay by phone (showing cellphone)""? -> Possible. 

\-More complicated ""directions"" like in a restaurant or how the bus system works? -> Very difficult, especially outside the very city centre, most menus are Portuguese only, staff's English is hit or miss. 

Personally, I've concluded that I will only return to Portugal with at least an intermediate level of Portuguese. 

NB: this is not an attack on Portugal - I understand their education system was very bad in the past and many older people never learned English in school. Just saying it kind of took away from my experience there a little bit. So I am wondering how other people deal with this."

Facts: 
1. My husband works for a California tech consulting firm. 

2. We will retain our California residency through a virtual mail service. 

3. We understand that California does not recognize FEIE, and we will continue to pay our California state taxes. 

4. We do not plan on telling his employer, we will be using VPN combined with a VPN router (Mango). We understand the risk. 

5. We plan on paying federal and state income taxes the whole year, and then filing for a FEIE exemption when we file our taxes next year, as we will be out of the country for the entire year. 

6. We do not plan on staying in any place long enough to become a tax resident.

q6dqxi,w6itg,Stay in EU with non-EU spouse,"Hi all,

I am an EU citizen with a non-EU spouse that is looking to stay in the EU for longer periods in. My spouse is only able to stay within the EU for 90 days out of 180 days on a standard tourist visa.

I know I can apply for a residency permit for her in my home country (NL), but that is quite limiting because it will require us to stay put in the country of residency, which will also make me tax residency there, both are things I am actively trying to avoid for the time being. Although eventually, we'd be settling down there (2/3 years). I don't mind setting up a base somewhere, but I'd really want to avoid high taxes, which is pretty much the entirety of the EU.

What are our options to being able to stay in the EU for extended periods?

One idea I have is applying for a Portuguese residency permit for my spouse with an NHR status for myself. As my job is based outside the EU, I could apply for the NHR to not be taxed in Portugal, though I am not 100% sure whether this would work for me. Though, ultimately I would like to move around at a slower pace, between my home country and other EU countries as well as around the world.

Thoughts?

Then I moved to China started freelancing til now.
3 months ago my AE card got cancelled becuz the credit card company decided not to work with Cathay Pacific anymore.( It was a cobranded card)

Due to the fact my location is in China right now, it's hard for me to apply for a credit card here with local banks as a non-china citizen. (No one really uses credit cards in China)

I use credit card mostly for online payment like paying for subscriptions And buying domains etc. Sometimes flight tickets too.

So question is: is there any credit card that doesnt require permanent address and proof of credit. I have savings but I think they'll need to see monthly income which I don't have now.

I've checked some virtual credit card in Hong Kong but they need you to have a company in Singapore first etc.

Maybe there are some solutions I dont know.

Here are the results for the zodiac poll: [https://ibb.co/qY0KGpk](https://ibb.co/qY0KGpk)

Going in, I was pretty confident that Sagittarius / Gemini was going to be the majority of people who answered the poll. 

Sagittarius is the sign of travel, foreign cultures, higher knowledge, philosophy, etc. 

Gemini is the sign of communication, ability to see things from multiple viewpoints even if they are contradictory, they are impulsive, flighty, and are great at wordplay.  All Geminis that I've met love to travel, incidentally.

Aquarius makes sense, too, because it's the sign of freedom, revolutionary ideas, networks, 'the broader collective', and detachment. All the Aquariuses I've met are the type of people who are willing to go across the world on a whim just for fun, and actually follow through with it.

I'm not sure how many Leos are actually included in the 13 people who voted ""Aquarius / Leo"".  If it turned out to be a majority, then that's really surprising to me. Leos, from my experience, are not the types to travel as a main hobby. 

Typical Leo traits are ""celebration of the self"" (individuality/pride), comfortable being the center of attention, have a natural charm/magnetic personality, and they like taking on leadership roles.

Thoughts?

For those who are into astrology, are the results in line with what you would expect?"

q71d90,ea8b0256,Not Another Airbnb Thread (What do DN’s actually use?),"So I’m officially starting my DN life in the New Year & after hovering this reddit for months the most confusing topic that comes up time and time again is Airbnb…

I’ve personally used the service a bunch of times (maybe 20), find it convenient, & never had any problems with hosts/customer service, but that’s just me and clearllyy not the over-arching sentiment here. I’ve also never used it to travel ‘full-time’ and understand that $ / cleaning fees etc. are getting kind of crazy & who doesn’t want to save as much $ as possible...?

Other options I’ve seen mentioned a bunch:

1) Facebook marketplace / expat groups: Seems like it would require quite a bit of additional work and you would obvsly need to be on the ground already to look at places… I know that people say Airbnb customer service is s\*\*\* and offers no protection but this seems possibly even sketchier in terms of addressing any potential problems…? But I do see how it could be way cheaper *especially for longer stays*. No cleaning fees, no huge mark-up etc. Just wondering what the savings/effort ratio is and how long people stay to make it worth it… couple months at least?

2) Using Airbnb but paying hosts directly to avoid service/cleaning fees…. If you pay to just stay for a few days then try to negotiate directly with the host off platform aren’t most places in popular areas going to be booked months in advance? Or do people just ask for a special % discount or side-deal directly from the host via the platform? I've seen both options mentioned... but not sure what the risks are in terms of Airbnb filtering messages / kicking people off… 

3) Hotels - whenever I’ve checked $ are usually at least 2x the cost so not sure I get this one even with point systems…. Or want to hang out in a hotel room all day with no/basic kitchen.

4) Booking/VRBO I’m not all that familiar with but haven’t gone a sense they’re really much cheaper than bnb.

Anyway, what do **most of you actually use**? I see a ton of Airbnb hate but usually when people ask about alternatives there’s no clear consensus… and I’m suspicious that a lot of these ppl still actually use the platform directly/indirectly because of the convenience… which I’m tempted by as well and would like more info on. Thanks all.

But airbnbs are getting more and more expensive and I have looked on FB groups for even short and medium term furnished rentals and the prices are often a lot lower so I have been considering alternatives but --

Does anyone actually do this? How do you know you won't be scammed? How do you know the place looks reasonably close to what the photos say (or that it even exists at all and it's not like the person on the other side will take your deposit and fuck off with it)? How do you pay once there (wire transfer, cash from the nearest ATM)?

And no, ""show up with a one week rental and then shop around once you get there"" is absolutely not an option for me -- I go to popular places during high season and I have a number of requirements so if I wait until I get there there will be nothing left with availability for the duration that I want (I don't want to constantly move around) at a reasonable cost."

q7mxxl,9u3kr6cg,What are the things that are interesting/important to you as a digital nomad ?,"Hi guys ! Being a devoted digital nomad myself :) (currently living in Bulgaria, last year was in Germany), I am finding that there are not too many resources around for us in one place. Thus, I thought it would be a cool idea to create a blog and write about various topics that interest digital nomads.

For me, I thought topics like how to secure oneself financially, how to do taxes, top countries to go to are what I would be looking to read about, so this is what my first posts were about.

Currently planning content about startups for nomads, investing options, language learning and more at https://easydigitalnomad.com.

But I would be really curious to know what kind of information/content other digital nomads are looking for, so that I can prioritize it for the website.

If you have any suggestions, please let me know, I'd love to research those !

q7p5cq,bk3cx6gu,Nomads who lift - what gear do you carry when travelling?,"It seems that it may be hard for me to get decent gyms for my next few destinations. I currently carry gymnastics rings, but those are clearly going to not be good for lower body maintenance. For those of you who lift heavy (250+ lb squats, 315+ lb Deadlifts), what resistance bands do you use?Are there other things you do or gear you carry when you have large swathes of time away from lifting iron? Any recommendations would be much appreciated!

Update: Bands are the way to go. I got some cheap ones from Amazon that worked well, but I also ended up getting some from elitefts that are great quality. The late and wonderful John Meadows/Mountain Dog has some fantastic videos on workouts to hit all the major muscles with resistance bands. I carry two of the thicker bands that give me plenty of resistance for squats (for reference I currently do 5x5s at 265 lbs) but I do them in higher rep ranges. Not a replacement for the barbell, but a pretty decent substitute if a gym is inaccessible for any reason. 

tl;dr: Resistance bands + gymnastics rings make a fantastic makeshift gym when you can't find one. John Meadows videos on YouTube are a great resource. elitefts are worth the premium IMO, but cheapos from amazon work decently as well."

q8tm9u,60wvpr2k,"Spent years dabbling in many tech related fields, but I still have no idea what direction I should go in. It's all a blur.","Hello fellas o/

So next semester I'll have finished enough gen ed classes and whatnot to get my associates at my community college. It's a nice milestone, but...

I don't know, I'm not sure what to do with it. My mind bounces around from IT to software dev, to website dev, to sysadmin, database manager, cyber security, etc. Never really had a job in any of these fields before.

I play a lot of games, naturally, but I also do a lot of random projects. I've made a lot of progress developing a 2d game on my own, made a bunch of different mods for games (mainly in lua), created websites, done a lot of video editing in different contexts, and a ton of other random stuff. Like I said, I have no direction, I just kinda go with whatever I'm 'obsessed' with for weeks or months. I feel... *okay* in a lot of these fields, but I'm always worried about how my skills would realistically fare in the 'real world' with working a job. I know imposter syndrome is common, but I really do feel like I'm at a major disadvantage with no impulse or idea on what to follow.

Been trying for the past 2 years to land a job of some sort with anything in these fields, but have made no progress so far. It's probably naive for me to think that I'd just be able to pick up anything and make it my job, but idk I've just been having so much trouble having a 'confident' mindset and making myself appealing to employers. I get a call asking about the job, I give information as confident as I can, then proceed to get ghosted. Every. single. time.

No idea what I do wrong, no idea how to improve, no idea what to change, if anything. I don't even know if I'm being too general or too specific. e.g. ""Should I go for a lua developer position, or take the lowest tech job there is and move from there?"". I kinda sorta have experience helping people with it, but again, literally no experience with an actual job in that field, so no frame of reference.

I'm thinking of going for an IT degree after getting my assoc, but I feel lukewarm about it. Originally tried going for CS degree, but I broke down from the stress and mentally I just can't weather it. Seems like every week or so I get obsessed with something new and want to make it my passion, until it's dead to me. It worries me that I won't be able to stick with any career due to my nature. I have a very chaotic mind that constantly flickers between moods and mindsets. One week I'll be a bubbling 'developer' working on reverse engineering the code of a game to change it to how I want, then the next week I'll be feeling like garbage because what I'm doing isn't relevant to anything and my skills feel useless.

Any advice? I've talked to family and others multiple times about this, but I never come to a conclusion. I've spent *years* trying to figure out what I want to do with my life, but I simply cannot make any more progress on that train of thought."
q8zmt8,81pkh6vs,How has customs/immigration treated you when coming back home after being away for 'long' periods of time?,"Just wrapped up 6 weeks in Mexico (first time going, also solo). When I arrived at my local airport I was getting grilled by the customs agent after I told her how long I was gone and where I was coming from. I guess my answers didn't satisfy her so she had me step aside and had some other agents search all of my belongings and they kept grilling me about what I was doing there for so long and what my occupation was and things like that. They didn't seem to like my explanation of 'working remotely and doing casual tourism concurrently'. They didn't find anything unusual searching my stuff (it was just clothes, books, remote working equipment, souvenirs, etc) so they let me go eventually. I saw one agent write a paragraph or two after looking me up so I can only assume it's some kind of report or note left on my personal profile within their own internal records.

For further context I'm a mid 20's male from the US and it was my first attempt at giving the digital nomad thing a go. As far as I'm aware ~~before COVID restrictions~~ US citizens could stay up to 6 months in Mexico ~~but they've halved that for now which is still 3 months~~ so I don't get how they kept making it seem like I was there for too long.

Idk, I guess I just want to hear from more experienced community members if this is the kind of thing to expect when living this type of lifestyle and if it is, how they deal with it."

q9a62p,,Coming to terms with wanting to be a nomad...,"Hi all,

Just wondering how others came to be digital nomads and how the lifestyle is working out for you.

I've had quite bad depression for several years and have been considering buying a property, yet despite spending hours online looking at properties, none have appealed. I work online and it kind of occurred to me after watching van life videos that this is the life I want. I want to just move around and be nomadic. That's why buying a property is just not something I could bring myself to do.

However, I feel a bit of awkwardness around it. I guess I'm a little worried about what others will think, even though I know that's stupid. I'm also wondering how I will make friends on the road... I rocked up in a beach town last summer for a while and loved being by the sea but I got lonely after two weeks. My solution was to go on Tinder. Not a good idea as I ended up just meeting assholes who made the trip less fun. But I do worry about loneliness. How do you connect with people while being a digital nomad?

qabilj,akd31674,Remote Work Knowledge: Where to Find Reliable Job Portals?,"Below are some key questions to ask yourself and some remote job sites to consider:

1. **Does the website offer the position I’m looking for?**

The most basic, but often overlooked, question. Some portals only provide specific industries, such as design or IT, so you may want to pay attention to not waste time looking for the unsuitable jobs.

**Does it require an upfront fee? Do the subscription packages make sense? Is it worth the investment?**

These questions depend on the country you live in. If you’re living in Asia for example, subscribing to a US-based job searching site will cost you a fortune (due to the money exchange rate). So look out and choose the one with the most reasonable budget for you.

**2. Is it safe to submit your documents on the website?**

Some portals store your CV to take advantage of your data, so you might want to be careful. Choose the remote job portals that allow you to submit documents directly to the recruiters/headhunters.

**3. Are the job postings reliable?**

There’s no right way to know this. As with the case of big websites (like LinkedIn), the owners won’t bother verifying how authentic the job postings are. To not waste time applying for fake hiring announcements, choose the job portals that guarantee recruiters’ reputation and reliability.

So now, where to find these portals? Here are 7 websites for your reference:

[Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/) (freelance jobs only)

When it comes to freelancing, there are only a few names that sound authentic. One of these remote job websites is Toptal.

Here is what you get from Toptal:

A diverse pool of freelance jobs ranging from developers, product managers, finance experts, and many more.

Toptal is regarded as the best in bringing freelance gigs to the top 3% talents from top companies including Bridgestone, Shopify, and Motorola.

Applying as a freelancer is free and you don’t pay any upfront fee.

The downside with Toptal is that they offer only freelance jobs. So if you are looking for full-time or part-time jobs, this might not be the best option for you.

[Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/)

Dribbble is a community of designers. This is where you find, interact and showcase your talent in graphic design, web, and UI design.

The advantages:

This remote job website is a huge community of fellow designers where you can find design jobs of various shapes and sizes.

You can create and host your portfolio which can attract potential recruiters.

They have a blog, a podcast, opportunities to meet up with other designers, and playoffs where you compete with other designers.

This remote job website has a budget-wise Pro plan of $5 a month when billed annually.

The only downside with Dribbble is it only focuses on remote designer jobs. Although the Dribbble team is 100% remote, you cannot find any other kind of job, which does not classify this as a completely remote job posting website.

[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/)

The most popular one on the list, LinkedIn is widely used in the corporate industry, from engineering graduates to top-tier personnel.

The advantages of LinkedIn are listed below:

Unlike a remote job posting website, it is built like a social media platform, making it easy to use.

You can post pictures, videos, short posts, and professional, long-form articles.

LinkedIn also provides courses, deep insights on jobs and professionals’ profiles when you subscribe to their premium plan.

Here are the downsides:

LinkedIn has not transformed into a remote job website. The remote jobs section is still developing yet there are not enough remote job postings.

There are a ton of jobs listed on LinkedIn with not enough information and offer below-average pay.

LinkedIn does not take any responsibility for the jobs posted on its website. LinkedIn will not step in to resolve any legal disputes between you and your recruiter.

[The Intern Group](https://www.theinterngroup.com/)

The intern group is focused on offering virtual internship opportunities to their applicants. Although they offer internships around the world, we target what their virtual internship opportunities look like.

Here’s the summary:

Their virtual internships are flexible and user-friendly. You can choose the hours, the duration, the time you want to start and offer 24/7 support.

If you are a graduate right out of college, this is the place to apply. The application is free as well.

Global Internships

Just like the Intern Group, Global Internships by Intrax offers virtual internships. Here is the summary:

Virtual internships are one of the many employment opportunities they provide.

They have a form that you can apply where you fill in details, select the domain you want to do your internship, submit your resume and that’s it.

Their 24/7 customer support, FAQs, and applying for a virtual internship are free.

[AngelList](https://angel.co/)

AngelList was launched in 2010 where you can find high-paying jobs from startups all over the world.

Here are the advantages:

AngelList focuses on the best startups in the business, where you can find the highest-paid jobs online.

Every job posting offers everything you need to know about the company, the employees, the funding, and the benefits they offer.

Apart from jobs, AngelList also allows people to invest in startups, post their jobs, and find the recently launched products in the market.

The significant disadvantage is even though there are good remote jobs, this remote job website suits best for experienced employees who are at least 5 years in the field. It is hard to find remote jobs for entry-level employees and college graduates.

[Waw Asia](http://waw.asia/?utm_source=seeding&utm_medium=Reddit)

We have a lot of attractive job opportunities and is growing fast to meet the growing demands of Asian remote working scene. Waw Asia is also expanding to the US/Europe regions at the moment.

qali9e,x1fsh1j,Using MasterCard abroad and getting caught in fraud detection?,"So, I've been living abroad for half a year now and my MasterCard always works on in-person transactions, but if I try to make a digital purchase in a foreign country (like digital purchases while using a DoorDash or Uber equivalent) it gets flagged as fraud. Then I have to manually call in and verify that I really did want to make that transaction.

qb4qlj,hil5k,How to save on medium-term housing?,"When reviewing travel expenses, the cost of lodging is by far the most expensive part. Of course it depends on where you go and where you stay, but still staying in hostels, apartments, and hotels is more expensive on a nightly average than renting somewhere.

How can this expense be reduced? My average cost per night (in Europe) tends to be about $30, which ends up being about $1000/mo. When traveling, I'll stay in a hostel a few nights then get a private room (budget!) somewhere because I need my own space, quiet, and a nice kitchen at times. 

How are you able to find less expensive accommodations? I would love to rent a private apartment for 1-2 months in Europe (Italy, Croatia, Sicily) or South America (Peru), but how can this be accomplished at a lower cost than a short-term private room?

For example, I was looking to stay in Southern Italy or Croatia for a month, but I am having a hard time finding medium term rentals, fully furnished, with WIFI, electricity, plates in the kitchen, etc...

I currently live in Portland, OR and wet season (basically now through March/April) drives me insane with my SAD. With this winter ushering in a la niña weather system that will bring more cold and wetness to the PNW, I need to GTFO.

**My situation:**

I'm a 30 year-old single gay dude that's pretty extraverted and experienced with solo travel. FWIW, I'm mixed Filipino and always end up blending in well in Latin America. 

I've been working fully remote for 4 years and my job + freelance client won't have a problem with me being a digital nomad. 

I love being in Portland from spring - early fall and I have a lot of ties here, so I'm not ready to drop my apartment yet. With Portland rent being a bit high, I'm looking to spend 1-3 months in a Spanish speaking region without breaking the bank.

Not rich, but I make decent money and could probably afford a short-term rental of up to $1K/month.

Intermediate Spanish speaking level. I can read in Spanish much better than speaking it. I really want to continue improving my Spanish, which is why I'm focused on countries that speak the language.

**Where I'm thinking of going**

I studied abroad in Costa Rica and visited again for a couple weeks before the pandemic began. Love it there and have some friends in Guanacaste, but it's not super budget friendly. 

While I love CR, I'm also thinking about Mexico and Spain. If you are currently or formerly nomading in these countries or other Spanish speaking regions, I'd love to learn about your experience and advice!

I'd also like to avoid COVID hot zones and places that are shutdown if possible.

(23M) Quick tldr of me. I'm a super confident and social guy who just likes to meet and speak to new people. I work in IT and recently broke up with my fiancé. I'm letting her keep most of the assets but I will receive a £10,000/$13,753 settlement. In December I will leave the home we brought together.

I've decided I want to take this opportunity to see the world and experience all it has to offer. 

I now have 2/3 options open to me:

1) Convince my job to let me work from Thailand. Live in Thailand for as cheap as possible (Chiang Mai) and travel on my days off. I work 3 days one week and then 4 the next. I'll be using apartments because I'll need the space and internet for business calls. If I stay full-time I'd pickup £2100/$2,889 a month. I could then travel around Thailand in a much slower fashion but at the same time increasing my budget. This option seems great as I can bide time while waiting for COVID restrictions to lessen. I could go from city to city working and absorbing all the culture. When Vietnam opens migrate and rinse repeat.

2) Quit my job entirely and go full backpacker. Cheap hostels and living on cheap food. True experience. I'd be limited to 6 months I believe with my budget (Have to buy gear). I really think COVID will destroy this plan as I'll be stuck in one place draining all my money. I believe I'd like to do the Banana Pancake route to start and play it by ear if I meet some interesting people with better ideas.

3) Wait..... I'm aware this is the most logical answer. But my answer to this is why not just work from Chiang Mai as I'll actually save more.

3.	 I have never been to Mexico. Will this affect my chances of getting a Visa?


4.	Is there any leeway given to the person who approves your visa? Can they make a judgment call?


Before anyone comments that I might not like Mexico. YES I AM AWARE. It is a risk I am willing to take. I have done extensive research on the country and feel comfortable taking this risk. Frankly I am miserable in the US and ready to get the hell out by any means necessary. Also do not worry about my long-term financial plan. I will be fine.

qclslz,poc45,Is there any list of which medications are available in which countries (and how much they cost)?,"I've been trying out a couple of drugs to help with depression and ADHD over the past year. Currently, I'm taking Wellbutrin. So far, it's my favorite. And I'm happy to have found something that works.

One good ""side effect"" of the med, though, is that it's given me renewed energy to move to a different country *or* do so for a portion of the year *or* go and do the whole digital nomadism thing. There are a couple of things to be worked through first, like finding a full-time remote job (right now I'm doing pretty well freelancing but it always feels a bit like a Jenga tower that could collapse at any moment). But ultimately I want to make it happen, moreso now than before I started treatment. I have a shortlist of locations too.

Any time I've thought about doing this, though, one question that always comes to mind as a potential complicating factor is ... what about medication?

What happens if you, say, want to live in Turkey for a few months but find that for non-residents Zoloft is insanely expensive and you can't afford it?

Or here's a non-hypothetical one: Wellbutrin isn't licensed in the UK for indications besides depression. It would be a major bummer to not know this and move to the UK (one of the options I've been considering) only to find that the only medication that has helped you so far will no longer be available. That could be life-changing. In a very bad way.

I figure that I can't be the only one who has these questions so I'd figured I would ask:

Is there some more efficient way of finding these things out that doesn't involve looking these things up on a country-by-country basis and asking locals how much drugs cost and which ones are available?

I think that digital nomadism sounds amazing and that there's going to be a great opportunity to do it when the world becomes more pleasant to travel through. But for those of us who take meds ... I feel like a bit of forward planning is required before hopping between countries."

Are my expectations just too low for accommodation prices or are there better options for me?  Rotterdam, for example, I am struggling to find anywhere to stay for those 2 weeks between 29th October and 13th November for less than £1,500 - £2,000.  This seems very expensive to me..."

I've got a remote job and have been trying to take advantage of the travel powers. I've been trying to see more and more of the country ""within reason, covid ya know"" and have been abusing AirBnb!...I do not like AirBnb as a service. One too many hack jobs.   


I am also a terribly inefficient traveler, and moving my monitor around is a pain in the butt...I feel like I'm nomad-ing wrong.    


  
SO, I will ask the experts!

  
For the nomadic pros in the audience....

How long do you usually stay in a given area?  


How do you deal with transporting your equipment? Recommendations?  


What services do you use to find housing?   


What would you tell someone trying to make this lifestyle work that they may have not thought about?

qdjzj7,brtxzn0a,What project management tool do you use/recommend?,"I'm not currently a freelancer but am looking to transition into freelancing in the next few months. I already manage projects at my regular job, but I've always just used excel, and it's not really working for me any more. I'd like to use something else developed specifically for managing projects that would also make my life easier when I start freelancing. 

I'd like to get some feedback from others here on what project management tool/s you use and if/why you recommend them. 

Features that I'd like - the board view of trello is fine, but that's not all I'd need. I'd also like a to do list type view like Monday.com, and timelines/gantt charts so I can see how projects will pan out over the coming weeks and months. But I want to be able to have this in one app. Are there any other features of project management /productivity tools that you use that you find particularly helpful? 

I'm not that interested in shareability or using it with teams/clients - just using it for myself. 

I'd love a free tool if possible, but realise that the features I want likely won't come without a cost, so at least not much more than £10 per month.

Some that I've come across that look like they might tick my boxes are:
 - Cushion
 - Asana
 - Clickup
 - Week plan

I plan to try these out to see how I like the UI/UX. 
Please share any positive or negative feedback on any of these if you use or have used them, as well as any not mentioned here! Many thanks."

I currently have 13 (not joking) fridge magnets in the bottom of my backpack, along with a carved turtle the size of my palm, a bong, 2 turbans, and enough bracelets to last me a lifetime. This is not an exhaustive inventory. I actually love that he is so sweet and generous. Not only to shower me in gifts, but also to pay the vender’s first asked price without hardly negotiating. Makes me feel like such a stingy asshole. The problem is, carrying all this shit is driving me crazy.

qdytox,2sjbncr,DN now or wait?,"Not COVID/quarantine related, more of a personal question.

Simply put, I've got itchy feet and have been wanting to try DN for a while. I'm actually pretty happy with my job at the moment; I don't make the most money but I pretty much have a guaranteed path to promotion in my current role and my COL is very low.

If I do take the plunge, I would ask my job if I could work internationally (I'm already remote) but I don't think it would be allowed due to restrictions on accessing our systems from outside the US, plus I don't necessarily want to have to deal with the time difference. I can also do freelance work but that would likely net me much less than I'm making right now, with the bonus of more flexibility.

My eventual goal is expat FIRE so I'm a little worried about the drop in income. I also have an older parent with health issues and there's a possibility I may have to take care of them in the future, financially and otherwise. 

TL;DR I want to try DN while I'm still young and have the inclination to do so, but I have a way to go to reach FIRE and also want to make sure I'm financially secure enough to care for my family if I need to. Do I stick it out in the workplace or just go, and move back/get a ""regular"" job again if it comes to that?"
qe3n91,4fjcizo4,Posted Yesterday About Prague Being More Expensive Than We Expected But Only Realized Today That None of My Thoughts About That Showed Up in The Post,"First off, to the ""Fucking Prague, Man"" people, thanks for making my day. Still laughing. 

Second, so far during our four years nomading we've lived in super cheap places like Bansko, Bulgaria, Hoi An, Vietnam, and Istanbul, Turkey. We've also lived in super expensive places like Grimentz, Switzerland. 

So I've got a pretty good handle on the variation between countries and I didn't expect Prague to be nearly as cheap as Eastern European countries, but based on friends who had been here in the past couple of years, I thought it would be closer to say Romania than other central and western European countries. 

Note, I'm not saying it's nearly as expensive as Vienna, where we just were, but it's a lot closer to Vienna prices than I imagined. 

A local Czech friend says prices of food in restaurants and groceries have gone up the past year. That's probably because of Covid, like in much of the rest of the world. 

But the fact is life here in Prague is WAY cheaper than our old life in Seattle. 

And I didn't mean to sound like I was complaining. Prague is an AMAZING city and I feel incredibly lucky to get to spend a month here, no matter the cost."

- Will first be flying into Paris (as well as eventually out of Paris) before flying to Porto. I applied for the Passe Sanitaire a few weeks ago, although I’m not sure it’ll be reviewed in time for my upcoming flight. Even if my Passe Sanitaire is approved though, would I be able to use it in lieu of the EU digital QR code in Portugal? I found conflicting information regarding this online. 

- If I’m not able to get a Passe Sanitaire or, even if I do but it’s not usable in Portugal, I’m a bit more confused as to how to approach it. Some websites (embassy, Reopen Europe, etc) have recent updates saying that a PCR test <72h is required to check into accommodations as well as dine indoors, some websites saying that only applies Fri-Sun, some websites say that that's no longer a requirement, and one website said that the CDC vaccination certificate would be accepted. Can anyone comment on this? Do I need to plan to get tested every 3 days?

qezb3p,8v9t9,Hotel recommendations,"Now that I've been a Digital Nomad for over a year, and traveling for work for more than 10 years, I find that I prefer staying in hotels for the following reasons:

* Earn points to use for free stays in the future - every year I stay in a hotel for a month or more for free.
* Earn status and the benefits that come with it.  Free room upgrades, staff knowing me by name, guaranteed reservations, dedicated email and support line, etc
* Hotels willing to give me personal virtual tours before I arrive
* Typically receive special gifts from the hotel during my stay
* Lifetime platinum at Marriott, highest status earned yearly at other hotel brands

However, it's really hard to find hotels that work well for extended remote work (I'm pretty specific about what I need - separate room to work, desk and comfortable chair, located in a walkable area, laundry on-site or nearby, etc).  I spend a lot of time finding hotels where I can stay for 3 months and it feels like home.

As a result, I have a list of hotels that are great for remote work, for me at least.

I'll share the entire list, including updates, with anyone that recommends their favorite hotel also!  Just fill out the following Google form [https://forms.gle/bmRMvU4icrBUuE5q8](https://forms.gle/bmRMvU4icrBUuE5q8) or share your recommendation in the comments below."

qfhl5g,g0yfk,"Report from Odessa, Ukraine, September 2021","When my vaccination was over, I was able to book a trip to Odessa. Unfortunately, because of the timing, I missed the proper summer and arrived on 1. September.

City

Odessa is an architecturally beautiful place and a quite modern city. Nice to be in, but without significant landmarks, you would have to visit. Walks to the sea will have to do.

There are two areas to choose from: downtown or Arcadia. There are quite far from each other so better be based in one of them rather than in the middle. I prefer downtown, but Arcadia is Odessa's summer party.

Beach

Still pretty cool in September, got like 8 proper beach days, but at the end of the months, a lot of businesses closed. I prefer the beaches closer to the city center rather than Arcadia, which is famous for its summer never-ending party clubs.

Local Odessa food

\- Vorschmack (salty minced fish spread)

\- Fried black sea fish

\- Sea mussels in cheese sauce (never had this combination before!)

Also available: local Ukrainian dishes, good Georgian restaurants

Things you can try outside food

\- Try Russian style sauna when it's colder outside

\- Try Flakon bar for great drinks you choose based on perfumes

\- Try a game room (smth like a karaoke room but with a Play Station, you can have drinks and shisha too)

Requirements to go

\- a Covid vaccination

\- locally sourced insurance (buy online easily on the gov site)

Costs

Surprisingly high considering my previous experience in Ukraine, but remember that this is like the top destination in the country. I recommend $1500-$2000/m for a good time.

\- $700 for a decent Airbnb with good location and cleaning (end of the season)

\- $6 for McD menu

\- $15 for a nice meal in a nice place

\- Some things like coffee and shisha can be real cheap everywhere

Pros

\- Beach is close to the city (30 min from downtown walking) and the city beaches are actually nice

\- Architecture is very nice in the downtown area, nice wide roads with trees

\- No cars on Sundays in the downtown area

\- 24h supermarkets, bars closing late (with last guests), and even 24h saunas (but only those you book as a whole)

\- Nice cafes (interesting and modern food options)

\- Cheap coffee (everywhere)

\- Cheap taxi to and from the airport (Uber)

\- Cheap shisha and cigarettes

\- A lot of unfiltered beer (which I prefer)

\- Almost no care for Covid and regulations (can be a con!)

\- All my Airbnbs came with cleaning

\- Not crowded beaches (for September)

\- Beautiful bike lanes from the center to Arcadia with sea views

\- Fire/bbq places in the park next to the sea (bring your own equipment)

\- A lot of electric scooters (but expensive)

\- Cheap Ryanair flights

Cons

\- Arcadia area wasn't as impressive to me (luckily didn't stay there)

\- Food in the center or at the beach can feel expensive (closer to Prague than the rest of Ukraine)

\- Outside and see temperatures are on edge for most people in September (23d water)

\- Many times Russian language is needed"

Originally I was thinking of spending a few months per location since 1) it would allow me to know a city really well 2) I would have longer to learn the language and potentially form friendships and 3) less travel overhead

However, as the list of places I'm interested in grows, it's tempting to cut that down to 1 month so I can experience more of the world. People who have tried DNing at both speeds: is there much difference between the two?

I'm also curious how far ahead people choose their next location. Have you sketched out a rough plan for the next year, or do you decide more in-the-moment?"
qgk8dr,jx1nko8,Coping with romantic loneliness,"Hello fellow DN's! I'm one year into being a digital nomad and I gotta say, I love it. It's the best thing I've ever done. I have zero regrets and I'm generally really, really, mind bogglingly happy. 

But, a year in, I'm starting to miss romance and romantic partners (I travel with a platonic friend and have folks who've visited a lot, so I get ""friend"" needs met very regularly). I very consciously made the decision when thinking about going DN that giving up romantic partners would be one of the costs of admission, and was ok with (still am, really). But, it's hard! I do actively date on a couple dating apps and have good success, but I'm only in a place for about a month or so before I move to my next place- hardly ideal for cultivating deeply connected intimate relationships. 

Fellow singleton travelers, have you found anything that has helped alleviate lonely feelings? It's not going to stop my nomadic living, but man. It would be cool to find some new tips and ideas for handling the challenging feelings.

Editing to add: I do short stays because I am working on a three year journey through North America in a leased car. Getting to see all the places I want to requires shorter stays, sadly! Otherwise yes, staying in places longer would be super helpful."

qglse4,,Anyone able to compare land vs sea nomading?,"Sea is probably a lot more expensive but what i like about it is that you can take your home with you, it's (usually) in range of one or many coastal ports, and you have periods of city adjacence and open sea travel, creating a nice contrast.

There is more to consider living on a boat. Maintenance knowledge becomes life or death potentially. We can talk about that but I hope to hear the actual lifestyle implications if anyone has tried out both or not. My guess is land nomadism captures much of the exotic of seaborne travel -- but not all of it.

Starlink is making sea digital nomadism more viable, especially in another 2 years.

Of course not having to moor a boat to go inland is also a nice feature."
qgnx9q,9u9j5,Are there any nice countries that grant residency and tax residency status without having to physically be there for over 6 months?,
qgsif6,9u9j5,Will countries recognize me as being a U.S. Tax Resident even if I don't physically live in the U.S.?,"edit: Country A = Japan  


I believe most countries around the globe if you're a citizen of will require you to be a tax resident in another country to be exempt from paying taxes in their country. We all know that U.S. taxes you no matter where you are in the world and considers you a tax resident but I was wondering whether the other countries recognize U.S. citizens as automatically having a tax resident base in the U.S. even if one doesn't physically live in the U.S..Let's say you're a dual citizen of Country A and the U.S. You lived in the U.S. for many years but are ready to try other countries and go on a nomadic journey to find where you may want to settle down. Country A is where your relatives live and would like to stay there up to the maximum length of stay allowed without being considered a tax resident. (often 183 days)Country A taxes more than the U.S. and you don't intend on living there full time so you do not want to be considered a tax resident in Country A. Country A requires that you are a tax resident in another country to be exempt from taxes there.Now you are off on your journey. You live in various non U.S. countries throughout the year including Country A but not long enough to be considered a tax resident by length of stay in any one of them.

Would Country A view that you're a U.S. tax resident even if you don't physically live there but did prior to the nomadic lifestyle and assets are based in the U.S.? Are you technically still a ""U.S. tax resident""?

How would claiming FEIE because you don't physically stay on U.S. soil for very much or not at all affect this scenario?

update:[https://nomadcapitalist.com/global-citizen/nomad-tax-trap-living-nowhere-harder/](https://nomadcapitalist.com/global-citizen/nomad-tax-trap-living-nowhere-harder/)

In this article written by Andrew Henderson at Nomad Capital, Andrew states that ""If you are a US citizen, the United States will always be your tax residence.""

From the U.S.'s perspective, U.S. is always your tax residence and all I need to do to claim the FEIE is to prove I wasn't on U.S. soil for over 330 days out of a 365-day period. However it's unclear whether the non U.S. country will recognize you having a tax base in the U.S. even if you don't physically live in the U.S. and are living a nomadic lifestyle.

*""If you’re a US citizen, you actually have an advantage because, if you meet the physical presence test by spending 330 days out of a 365-day period in a foreign country or countries, then you can take the* *Foreign Earned Income Exclusion* *(FEIE).*

*Under the FEIE, the US doesn’t ask you to prove where your new tax residence is as long as you spend enough time outside of the United States to prove that it is no longer your home. That doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re going to pay zero tax, there are other things involved, but you can still live nomadically and qualify for the exclusion.*

*The other benefit is that you can claim the exclusion and still report the United States as your tax residence because there is no way to fully get out of filing and paying taxes in the US. If you are a US citizen, the United States will always be your tax residence. This can be beneficial when setting up a foreign bank account as banks will want to know where you pay taxes before accepting you as a client. ""*"
qguoak,1pdky9x5,Radio interview with a Mexico City immigration official,"
Tourist FMM Visas, Temporal & Permanente Visas, Tax implications etc:

Earlier this week there was a live radio broadcast with a guest ""Ejecutivo senior de inmigración from INM Mexico City .

Here is a summary of what he said. 

INM has been more diligent recently in attempting to crackdown on misuse of tourist visas. Not to punish travelers but to educate and inform. INM agents are asking for more proof of travel itinerary, such as hotel accommodations/dates and Return flight tickets, length of stay, etc . 

**Regular tourists ( typical 1-3 week stays are given appropriate tourist visas) Simple 30-180 day 

**Snowbirds and longer term stays (Agents look at at age & retirement factors in assesment) are again given appropriate time based FMM's based upon length requested and satisfying the agents queries on particulars....Note: there is one exception to this & that's if these snowbirds own and rent property in Mexico: ie Mexican based income. When the situation arises of Rental Income and Taxes, Application for Temp or Perm Residency is expected.

**Remote Workers/Digital Nomads....(tend to be younger travelers) INM officials believe if you work in a country, you reside in that country not as your typical tourist... Officials want these travelers to apply for residency. Again, agents assess situation based on age, accomodations, length of stay, return plane ticket etc) Recently, agents are screening this group more intensely...for length of stay, repeated stays, basis of income , (Mexican or Foreign) etc. Length of tourist visa given is now trending shorter.

**Repeat or Serial Tourists...with all trip history available to INM agents, updated and synchronized, they can quickly point out misuse of tourist visas. Any one who stays for 180 days, leaves and comes back for another extended period within the same year are obviously living in Mexico and not their native country. They are now being flagged by agents and given short FMM periods or will be denied entry altogether. They will be encouraged to return when they apply for residency.

** There are other flags that agents look for when assessing visas, such as criminal activity, country of origin, etc"

For the record I'm currently in Tbilisi, Georgia where I've been for a couple days. So far I've found it kind of cold and boring here (to be fair I'm coming from Rome, so I'd probably feel that way in most cities right now), but I did just discover this Fabrika place so maybe it'll be more fun staying/going there tomorrow evening.

I'm considering:

* Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herzegovina - looks beautiful, but I imagine probably not the most fun place to be for Halloween (?)
* Tirana, Albania - seems boring, but I'm curious because it's different and off the beaten path
* Skopje, North Macedonia - also seems boring
* Belgrade, Serbia - I've been here before and had a great time. Nightlife of course is great so would probably be fun for Halloween. I did however want to try somewhere new

Places I'm not considering due to COVID restrictions:

* Ukraine - Ukraine is entering code red on the 30th
* Romania - 10pm curfew, outdoor mask mandates

Other possibilities:

* Cyprus - could be interesting as a city break but I need to do more research
* Sofia, Bulgaria - everyone seems to say it's ugly and boring
* Istanbul, Turkey (I've already been, so not interested in going again)
* Croatia - already been to Zagreb which was kind of boring. Since it's winter now, I'd imagine the coastal towns are probably dead
* Yerevan, Armenia - don't know much about here, but I'm guessing it's sort of similar to Tbilisi

I grew up in MA, went to school in CT, went back to MA, and then lived in Austin, Texas for 10 years. Then I lived with my parents in Galveston, Texas for a few months before setting out on my DN journey, and still sort of keep it as a home base for now. I usually explain all this when asked the question. 

I'm hyper-aware of the reputation of the places I'm from (Texas, specifically) so sometimes I'm unwilling to admit to living there, and it's not technically where I'm ""from"" originally. Explaining that I'm nomad-ing around does make for a good conversation starter, though.

Just as it says in the description, My wife (31) and I (35) want to move to Latin America for 6 months to a year before we have kids. So we are making a list of a few places that need to have a nice culture/people, good enough internet, affordability, cheap good healthcare, decent air quality, and safety. 

I speak Spanish, she doesn't but wants to learn. 

Are there any places you would recommend that I am forgetting?  

We need recommendations and opinions for places in:

* Mexico - we heard Merida is both nice and safe, where are some other spots that would be good for us? I've only really been to the tourist spots in Mexico with my parents when i was growing up but i know there is a very rich culture/history there. 
* Argentina - I did a highschool exchange here in a town called Reconquista when I was 17. I loved Argentina and I know it is very affordable...but is it safe these days? Would Rosario be a nice option for us?
* Costa Rica - never been, but i've heard great things.
* Uruguay - Also never been, what would be a nice place for us here?
* Colombia - Went to Medellin and Santa Marta 2 years ago. Medellin was culturally very cool, but I did not dig the air quality in the city. 

Are there any other places you would recommend to us that I am forgetting?

Lastly, and importantly, how much do you think we need to live in these places for a year? We don't need to live like kings or anything but we would want to be comfortable.

We loved our previous time in Bansko but we never imagined going in winter. But every time we looked at other alternatives like Croatia, Albania, Montenegro, Istanbul, Dec/Jan/Feb looked pretty wet and dreary in those places. We also considered southern Turkey  but places like Fethiye or Antalya didn't seem quite right either. 

Finally it occurred to us that spending part of the winter where it's properly winter -- snow and mountains with sunny days -- made the most sense since what I was most dreading was rain and grey. 

Plus, because of Covid it's mostly been the two of us this year, and we really loved the DN community there. It'll be really nice to hang out with people again.

qkafme,dsro0xbv,"Ideal ""digital sabbatical"" locations","I'm 23, in my last year of university and honestly, I'm about to fail some of my classes. 

This got me thinking. I started university to become better at programming (CS Bachelor), but call me weird, but I never wanted one of those FAANG jobs, or any average programming job for that matter.

All I wanted was to travel the world, work on personal projects, and maybe, just maybe, make some cash from them. All that's important is that it's my own projects, my own money, etc. Maybe I'll regret this later, but honestly, I don't care if I didn't make a fucking dollar for a year. Call me arrogant, but I got enough buffer money to survive that.

So there's some backstory, enough about my personal life. To conclude: I want a place that's as frugal as possible, while also offering (some) places with decent internet. Doesn't have to be consistent, just that if there's a meeting or something, there's at least one facility that offers decent speed. Also, the place should be warm, and I prefer Spanish (or other Latin languages) speaking countries.

I have $10k to spend freely, and I would like to stay for at least a year, so consider that if you have information about rent and cost of living and such."

I applied for and was denied a VOLUNTEER position to be an English speaking companion for Europeans studying over the summer … denied because my passport wouldn’t allow me to enter the EU right now due to Covid. Never mind that I’m fully vaccinated. There’s no logic at all.

qkmqwi,2lunhiwa,Convincing HR to let me become a digital nomad,"My company is offering people the ability to go fully remote.  They’ve got no problems with people living in other states permanently but things start to get squirrelly when you move around a bunch do to tax implications.   
  
My idea is to live in Mexico till April, then Dominican Republic till June.  Colombia for a 3/4 months then another South American country to round the year out.  

I think if I live less than 183 days in any of the countries I won’t have tax implications.   But I’m not exactly a lawyer or tax cpa…. 

Should I consult with a tax expert or lawyer and lay out my plans to them and see what all would need to be done to make sure everything would be in good standings for my company?

ql07rd,2o0exdu0,Some clarification on NHR scheme - Portugal,"I notice many posts here and on some expat forums on NHR (Non-Habitual Residence) program in Portugal touting it as extremely lucrative zero-tax scheme which, as per my research, it is not.

In fact, there's a highly-upvoted [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/qjs5lf/portugal/) on this recently as well. They're selling Portugal as a nomad's pipe dream of warm climate, beautiful culture, access to EU passport, and no tax liabilities for a long run. Sharing my knowledge below:


**Claim/Myth:**

NHR is 10-years tax-free regime. Your foreign-sourced income won't be taxed in Portugal for 10 years. Interpreted as, ""once you're a digital nomad in Portugal on D7 or a Golden visa, you can opt for NHR and enjoy a tax-free ride for 10 years"".

Wrong.

**Reality check:**

At first look, the NHR looks great: For 10 years, you get to pay no taxes on *foreign sourced income*. Gee, I will just set up myself in such a way that my income is foreign-sourced, and voila! No taxes!

So what if I set up a legal entity in country X and pay myself dividends?

**Offshore company in other countries**

Think Malta, Cyprus, Caymen Islands, Hong Kong, Singapore, UAE, etc.

Holding companies fall into the scope of CFC (Controlled Foreign Company) regulations - and aforementioned entities structure are often deemed ""not transparent"" by the Portuguese IRS, thus attracting greater scrutiny.

According to OECD frameworks, if you’re the sole shareholder and director, it can be deemed by Portuguese taxmen that the company’s effective place of management is Portugal and therefore that the corporation should be taxed in Portugal.

This would leave you liable for Corporate Income Tax (21%) + Personal Income Tax (highest slab: 48%) on the dividends. Not zero tax.

The only way to avoid it is by demonstrating *sufficient economic activity* in the country of incorporation. You can try that by renting offices in that country, hiring staff, appointing educated and qualified directors to the board, but chances are your costs would be far larger than the tax-rate you'd incur in Portugal. Not to mention, there's no guarantee here as well that you'll pass scot-free.


**US-based company (Delaware, Wyoming, Nevada etc.)**

I would be cautious about assuming that a US LLC (Delaware/Wyoming/New Mexico) will be considered transparent in Portugal. In the UK, Canada, and France, rulings have considered them opaque.


**UK-based LLP**

A UK LLP might be a better option - based on my research and informational interviews conducted, it gets a green light as a ""transparent entity"". Hence, you may qualify for Portuguese NHR. 

You’d then declare UK LLP profits as professional income.

You’d have to pay 21.4% of social security on “relevant/taxable income”, which is 70% of reported income.

So if you make 100K in profits, you’d pay 14,980 or 14.9% in social security. It seems you can opt-in for a further 25% reduction, reducing this amount to 11,235 or 11.2%.

Finally you’d pay 20% income tax on the after SS profits, or 17,758.

This would mean that your total burden SS + Tax (effective tax rate) would be **28.9%**. Potentially better than many countries but more like average than

**For some, simply registering as a freelancer in Portugal and using the simplified tax regime rather than the NHR could result in better rates**, depending on the amount of money you make and your margins. A self-employed freelancer echoed this sentiment. 

In light of above, **NHR is not a tax-free dream that some websites/immigration agencies pitch as, at least for the digital nomads (remote workers).**

**Bottomline:**
 

Highly recommend talking to a tax specialist to set you straight on this instead of trying to DIY tax management. There are a lot of intricacies to Portugal's tax system and Portuguese IRS is quite aggressive. IMO though, taxation should not be the only benchmark. Portugal is an affordable and very safe western democracy with easy immigration, a vibrant culture, multicultural and tolerant society, good public education, and an excellent healthcare system."

Folks had a lot of thought on that decision!

We weren't put off by the talk of air pollution or high heating bills. Those are concerns, of course, but nothing we weren't willing to put up with for what we'd get in exchange. 

But the exploding Covid rates in Bulgaria? That put us right off. 

I'm not sure why I dropped the ball this time. In our travels throughout Eastern Europe this year, I've done my due diligence and been very comfortable with our choices, either because things seemed well in hand with mask usage being high and/or vaccination/infections rates decent.  

But I guess I got too comfortable in thinking things were pretty good everywhere, which was very dumb on my part because things in Bulgaria are definitely not all right. 

So thanks again to everyone who (nicely) suggested we rethink our decision. It's one of the great things about the DN community."
ql5wcy,2mj6aso2,Need US Based Phone Solution,"What are US expats, long travelers, or digital nomads using for phone service / data when out of the US?

(I wasn't quite sure what subreddit to put this, expat, expatfire, digitalnomad, but this one had the largest audience so I thought I would try here first.)

I have the T-Mobile Magenta plan 70 a month. Its supposed to be good for US, Canada, Mexico. I've been in Mexico since end of June. I don't use my cell hardly at all, mostly wifi whenever possible. But, just this week I got a text from T-Mobile,

""The Majority of the recent T-Mobile usage on line xxxxxx has been roaming internationally. Per our terms and conditions roaming benefits are not intended for extensive use abroad. You can use Wi-Fi to reduce your international usage.""

I was not aware that I was roaming international. The T-Mobile salesman said it would work fine for 180 days in Mexico, so I don't know what changed, haven't had a chance to call them.  But I always turn off the cell now when I'm traveling around.  I only use it when my wife and I are separated or I have to check a map or something real quick and don't have wifi.

The main thing I wanted a steady number for was 2FA with US financial companies, when I'm out of the US.  I thought google voice would solve this, but when I tried to register my google voice number in some instances it would get rejected and the rejection would say something like, they could only use a real number.

Someone else mentioned google fi, I haven't checked into it yet, because

[**wanderingdev**](https://www.reddit.com/user/wanderingdev/), wrote in another thread, ""google fi has the same rule. you can only use it outside the US for 6 months a year and then your data is turned off. the only real long-term solution is a google voice number and local sims. any US based plan is going to have time restrictions."" , "" I have friends that use google fi and they just ONLY use it for 2fa. otherwise it's turned off and they get a local sim. one has a dual sim phone the other has a cheap old phone that they only use for that. ""

It would be helpful to find an affordable US based service to use as a ""home base"" number for 2FA and communicating with financial companies, and buy local sims for data as needed.  I guess a dual sim phone would help if that is the solution, but I don't know what telephone company/service would fit that bill.  Or what other strategy I might use to accomplish the same thing."

In December, I depart for Central America where I’ll then start working my way south. I am going with a friend I’ve traveled with once previously for about 2 weeks. 

I am feeling terrified. How do you just jump in with both feet? How are you not worried all the time? Do you guys feel scared or worried? I have a lot of “what ifs”. I know that if I go, once I’m there, I’ll be fine and I’ll adjust but the build up has really caused my anxiety to go up.

ql6e1x,e13s0bap,Bali Quarantine: Help Me Clarify Current Requirements,"Hey all,

With Bali reopening its international borders, my partner and I are evaluating whether to fly there at the end of the month or not. I'd appreciate some help in clarifying some of the details regarding the mandatory quarantine.

 The literature I've found online is a bit confusing and not always updated. But here's what I've gathered so far:

* You currently need to quarantine at government-designated hotels for 5 days upon entry (even if vaccinated, which we both are)
* You're required to do a PCR test upon entry and another one at the end of your quarantine
* When booking a hotel, you \*have to\* (?) book a ""quarantine package"" which includes room, meals, PCR tests, and daily laundry service (in case you're contaminated I guess?)

Now, let it be known my partner and I are budget travelers, and $1,000+ for 4 nights in a hotel would sting. Anyone has recently entered and managed to pay less?

For example...   
Any workaround to avoid the ""quarantine package""? (ie. pay for your own covid tests, get food delivered, etc.)  
Would it be cheaper to enter through Jakarta vs Bali?   
Any idea what the cheapest government-designated hotels are?"
ql6zw7,50xw0fmu,Renting car in the US for 1-3 months,"My spouse and I are retiring this year and intend to be nomads for the next few years. We have sold all of our possessions except for couple of boxes of keepsakey stuff and what will fit in our suitcases. We will likely keep visiting the US since most of our family is here. Unfortunately, they are not in big cities, so access to a car will likely be essential. Consequently, I have been looking at options for long-term car rentals. The typical car rental companies seem to charge about $50/day, while peer-to-peer rentals like Turo charge $30 (both all inclusive). $30/day or about $900/month is obviously much higher than what you would pay for a lease, but it is within the range of what we would be willing to pay.

Although we are willing to pay that, we would rather not pay that much. So, my question is, what other options might be out there that I have not considered. 

Two other possible options seem to be too much trouble and/or have too much financial risk - 1) buy a used car and sell it when leaving, and 2) take over a lease which ends around our departure date. I will likely sound out this question in a different subreddit."

1. I know México is getting a little stricter on the tourist visa and not always giving the 180 days now. I think having a return ticket about 170 days out is probably the most secure way to make sure I get the 180, true? Only difficulty is knowing which airport I would fly out of to come back, though probably would be through Cancún (to RDU).
   1. Edit, also considering temporary residence? I seem to meet the requirements listed. Does anyone have an practical experience going through this process?

2. What cities are good for coworking with WiFi Speeds 100+ (in the coworking, not in my airbnb)?! I love the idea of Playa, but I'm hearing mixed reviews on actually being able to do 3-4 months in Playa. I'm also playing with the idea of signing a 6-month lease while doing 1-2 weeks at a time in other cities in México. Though at that point don't know if that financially makes any sense. Having a base is nice, but more expensive than necessary maybe.

Currently I have:

* Oaxaca
* México
* Playa (including Isla Mujeres, Cozumel, and surrounding areas)
* Mérida (I'd say that's far enough away)
* San Miguel de Allende
* Torreon/Monterrey
* Puebla
* Guadalajara
* Aguascalientes
* Querétaro

qlzxjv,17sxlezq,First Month as Digital Nomad Traveling the US by Car with Pups,"Hello fellow/future DNs,

My wife and I are wrapping up our first month as digital nomads and just wanted to post our entire experience thus far in case it is helpful for anyone else out there.  Long post, so enjoy.

TLDR; Husband, wife, 2 pups and a car.  Wife quit her non-remote job, sold house in the suburbs, put everything into storage, hit the road, and so far loving every minute of it!

**Background**

I have been fortunate to have always had a remote position my entire career working in Web Dev, Digital Marketing, etc.  Being a Digital Nomad has always been a dream of mine, but life always got in the way of making it happen.  Well then 2020 happened and truly showed me (and I'm sure a lot of people) the things that are the most important in your life.  Not being able to even work remotely at coffee shops etc really set off my cabin fever, and mind you I've been doing remote working 100% for 13 years and even I was going stir crazy.

In July 2021 Italy reopened to US travelers and I had a ton of miles/points built up and took a cheap vacation to Rome.  Not even 2 days into our trip I looked at my wife and just flat out said ""I'm tired of the same'ol same'ol and something in our life has to change.  No excuses. Period.""  The initial seed had been planted.

The rest of our trip all we talked about was how to make being a digital nomad a reality.  I have a great job with great pay and work from home.  She was working in the child care space and had been diligently rising in her career at the time.  

For a few weeks we agonized over if we were being crazy, could we really do this, was this the right time, selling the house is a huge hassle, the house is in a great location/investment, what would she do about her job, and we did a **ton of research** on digital nomads.  Read/Watched everything we could get our hands on.

Long story short here, I crunched the math and we decided it was just time for her to quit her job (Had an office job, but they refused to let her do remote) and for us to sell our house and do this.

Mind you at the time we had literally everything we ever dreamt of, sacrificed for, and worked our asses off for.  Amazing jobs, no debt (minus house), 2 story brick home in the suburbs, happy marriage and planning on having kids.

But at the end of the day we just knew we wanted something different out of life.  Literally have ZERO complaints overall about life, and I fully understand just how lucky/fortunate we are in this world. But that doesn't mean you can't want something else.  

The final decision maker was when we decided to contact [OpenDoor.com](https://OpenDoor.com) and within days received a 100% cash offer on the house at above fair market value (North Texas) in a housing market that was at all time highs.  We set our own closing date, didn't have to fix anything, no inspections, no buyers/agents, 100% ZERO hassle.  This decided it for us.  If we were going to do this, we could cash out of the house at the height of the market and do it on our own timeline.  This for me removed what I saw as the absolute biggest hassle.

Sold the house, put everything we cared about into storage, and left in our car with 2 pups, 2 suit cases, and 2 storage tubs for essentials.

**Our First Month**

We decided our first month needed to be 'easy' to attempt to eliminate as much hassle starting out of the gate as we could.  Did an AirBNB for a nice 2 bedroom condo in Orlando for 5 weeks.  We drove 2 days from TX to FL while stopping overnight at an AirBNB in Alabama, reeeeeeeally helpful when you're traveling with dogs.

I'm so glad we started with a place that was basically breaking our monthly rental budget.  It was big, full kitchen, space for the dogs, dedicated workspace, and easy access to everything (groceries, restaurants, and the Dollar Store!)

So far my absolute favorite thing is not worrying about maintaining my own house.  Mow yard, fix this, fix that thing over there, stressing about some future problem/project/etc.  Pheeeeeew

I will say, for us at least, a month is enough time in a single location.  We love to travel and want/need new things.  The last week or so I've gotten the familiar feeling of ""Ok what do we do now?""

**Challenges**

* Dogs
   * Ohhhhh buddy, did I underestimate traveling with dogs.  They are amazing in the car (their favorite thing) but changing locations is rough on dogs and definitely takes more getting used to their routines than anticipated.  Current AirBNB does not have a yard, so frequent walks, lots of dedicated training/playtime, etc.  Recommend possibly budgeting for daycare/boarding if possible, if needed.
* Internet
   * Our AirBNB advertised over and over how amazing the Gigabit wifi is.  Nope.  WiFi didn't work when we got here.  I forgot my ethernet cable/adapter for Macbook.  Used my backup hotspot the first few days until I discovered where the modem/router was and literally just had to reset/configure it myself to get working.
* Eating Healthy
   * Made an obnoxiously expensive run to Walmart the first day to get groceries to cook/eat as healthy as possible only to discover the cookware here was garbage, difficult to prep, small cooking space etc.  Could have done this better.  Led to eating out way more than intended.  Will need to be more diligent about eating in next month.
* Work Life Balance
   * First week and a half I was extremely diligent about routines of getting up early, walking dogs, working out, then work 9-5, cook dinner, walk dogs, go to bed, then repeat.  While this is a great strategy it became apparent we weren't really doing anything different than back home.  We needed to include more entertainment and fun things to do and not have the same feeling of just surviving.  Still working on finding the right balance, routines are **absolutely crucial**, but don't over do it.

**Pros**

* Not Owning a Home
   * I'm first and foremost a numbers guy, always worried about $$, worried about planning for the future etc.  While a home is one of the best investments you can make if done right, not having the hassle of maintaining an entire house, yard, repairs, etc has been **wonderful** 
   * Very aware of potential losses in future equity gains of the house, I personally made the decision these potential losses were worth every penny and really just an investment in ourselves to enjoy life to our fullest
* Feeling Relaxed
   * Your daily life/routine/work exists but I really do feel like we're on vacation almost every day.  Definitely less stressed and very relaxed.  Very stressful work projects are even easier to handle/focus on.
* New Experiences
   * New experiences are worth their weight in gold to us.  New beaches to explore, new places to hike, new places just to walk the dogs and experience has been utterly phenomenal and can't wait for more!
* You Can Always go Back
   * I mapped out several plans of the ""Just in case we don't like this nomad thing"".  You can always move somewhere and get an apartment or go rent something and/or you can find a place to settle.  I don't think this is really a drastic issue, but plan for it in case you need it and you'll have that much more peace of mind.
* We're actually doing it!
   * Feels amazing to make such a drastic life change.  You might have friends/family telling you you're crazy, but that's just because you're doing something literally 99% of the population can't fathom.  For older generations this is something that was not even an option for them and only a fantasy.  If you feel in your soul that this is something you need to do, then plan it, start making decisions towards it, and you can make this a reality.

**Recommendations**

* Plan
* Plan
* Plan
* Plan your ass off.  
   * Not from a stressful perspective of over worrying about what can/will go wrong, but make a plan/timeline of where you are going, how you will get there, what you will do once there, what your routine will be, and where you will go next.  
   * Plan for contingencies: Is my cell going to work? What/Where do I do/go if internet is down?  Do you need a backup hotspot?  Where to do car maintenance?  Where are grocery stores?  What are prices of everything where you will be going? (Holy crap groceries are more expensive here!)
* Have the Right Expectations
   * You will not be able to necessarily change things you don't like where you are staying.  Uncomfy mattress?  Small living space?  Well, you're just going to have to deal and just know that going in.  It's not 100% puppy dogs and rainbows, but it's sure a hell of a lot better than what you're probably doing now.
* Pack Light but Bring Necessities
   * We have 2 travel tubs and packed more than we probably needed, but it's really nice to have things that we literally use every single day and make it feel like home for us.

I don't want to hop around countries frequently. I think it is exhausting. I wanna pick a country, stay there for few months and move to somewhere else. 

Indonesia business visa looks perfect for this. 60 days entry and can extend 4 times 1 month each. 

 I think having somewhat a social life is important for me.

I know Indonesia is a Muslim country and all that stuff. 

But even with all that, i seem to notice lot of westerners still go there.

qmkvy6,4fjcizo4,Traveling to homophobic countries (and getting criticized for it),"When I post here (and on other social media platforms) about being a gay digital nomad who has lived in less than tolerant countries such as Turkey, Hungary, and Bulgaria we often get criticized and hear comments such as: 

* Don’t you know how Turkey treats queer people?
* In case you haven’t heard, Hungary just passed a very anti-LGBTQ law! How can you support that government?
* Hey guys, what is it like living in such homophobic countries? 
* Aren’t you afraid?

The answer to these questions and other is incredibly complicated, which is why we wrote an entire newsletter about it. And, of course, it isn't only gay issues that raise these questions for digital nomads. I think all of us here have to deal with things like sexism, racism, how poor people are treated, the environment and so forth in the countries where we choose to live. 

The TL:DR answer is 

1 & 2) Yes, we know how Turkey treats queer people. We lived there, made friends with them, and got tear-gassed alongside them at Pride. And we know all about Hungary's law. (And we write about these things to do our small part to help make things better.)

3) Living in these countries can be complicated but ultimately very rewarding. (And we aren't about to lest fascist, wannabe dictators keep us from seeing amazing places and meeting wonderful people.)

4) No, we aren't afraid because a) we do our due diligence and understand any risks we might be facing and b) because of something we call the Weird Foreigner Rule, which says that as outsiders, local rules and mores usually don't apply to us (up to a point), especially since we're there spending money. 

Here's the [link if you want to read](https://brentandmichaelaregoingplaces.substack.com/p/is-it-okay-to-travel-to-homophobic) the whole thing and I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts. 

When responding, I would also encourage people to not think of a country like Turkey or Hungary as just ""one"" thing. Just like America has both Texas and Vermont, no country is a monolith of beliefs and behaviors. When it comes to LGBTQ issues Budapest is pretty damn different from rural Hungary, and I doubt there are many Americans who would stay away from Dallas or Austin because the state leadership of Texas is pushing so much horrible conservative legislation."

qnk1oe,40vag,PSA- Not paying taxes while working from another country is illegal to the respective traveled to country.,"This is probably something that will cause a storm but I want to say it anyway to get clarity on the subject.

A lot of digital nomads are simply traveling to another country and withholding information from to that respective country. DNs don't disclose they will be working remotely in the said country. Instead they simply say they will vacation or other such purposes. I can't speak to know how common occurrence this is but I would guess very.

It's probably illegal for a DN to be working remote in a respective country (depends on the country's codes). However, it's not likely something the average individual will get caught for doing. There are many privacy laws put in place where it becomes quite easy for an individual to hide such sensitive information. I don't know if countries care enough to crack down fully on it especially as it may be helping them bring income to their country. It's also extremely common and popular as there are many DN around doing this ""illegal"" activity.

I'm not here to be the bearer of bad news but I do want to find the fine line of doing this type of thing sustainably and in good heart/faithfulness.

How do you all cope with knowing this truth? There's another post on the reddit homepage right now, how someone is making money being a DN and having a lower cost of living but that is only the case because technically he is likely doing something illegal? 

I am not here to judge one side or another. I actually want people to become more free and travel around in a digital nomadic lifestyle if they can afford it. However, I am not necessarily for doing things that are technically illegal in a small way."

qomo3i,lhewq,Dealing with unreliable internet,"For the first time I've been traveling abroad and trying to do a lot of video calls at the same time and it is getting super annoying. The places I've been staying or visiting often have good wifi in general and usually reviews that praise it but many still have periods where the connection drops out for up to 20 seconds at a time.

This would be fine for most uses (even family video calls it's not so bad) but it's really shit for work video calls. It happened yesterday where the wifi was more or less fine for an hour into a boring meeting and then at the exact point when I needed to talk it cut out.

I have tried tethering to avoid this but I have ended up chewing through 20GB in a week (1/2 of what I bought for a month) along with a 10 second lag where I have to manually switch from one wifi connection to another at which point I might have missed a critical part of the meeting and/or pissed off my coworkers.

My dream would be to have some sort of travel router that can connect to wifi and automatically failover to 4G with no more than a couple of seconds drop off but I don't think it exists.

Anyway, I'm curious to know what strategies you all have for dealing with unreliable internet since I'm sure you all have some variant of this problem.

Edit: if I had a rooted phone it appears I could combine https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ardadem.vpntethering&hl=en_US&gl=US&showAllReviews=true with speedify, which looks like it might do the trick.

qomyt7,42k8k06o,Tanzania: Not recommend for DNs,"Been there for nearly 3 months and I really want to warn/inform people about Zanzibar and the mainland as both destinations have become somewhat popular due to the lack of covid restrictions. Apart from the nice looking pictures there is a lit of negative aspects that needs to be considered. 

Obvious problems that I was aware of before going: Accomodation is of very poor quality, prices are high, the eletricity black outs are frequent and the internet is poor as well.

Regarding Zanzibar: The main attractions are Stone Town and the beaches. Stonetown is nice and worth staying a few days but the beaches are IMO ruined by annoying touts, Masaii and most of all beach boys. It is very hard to set foot on any of the beaches without getting hassled for sex (if you are female), drugs, souvenirs or tours. Zanzibar is a major sex tourism destination - something people dont talk about for whatever reason - is it because white woman are engaging in it? 

Zanzibar as a whole is not attractive compared to places like Bali, Phuket, Koh Phangan etc. The interior is totally flat and often consist of scrub and dry areas, the beaches are beautiful but full of sea weed and most of all there is trash everywhere. Apart from the pictures of the beaches you see online it is really not a particularly nice place.​ 

That being said, most of the local people are nice apart from the obvious tourist pricing all the time.​

The places I visited on the mainland were Dar Es Salaam and Moshi. I would recommend neither. Dar is not bad but really offers very little compared to other big cities.​ Lacks character and history and is also pricey compared to Asia. People are  often not friendly at all unless you are a paying customer.​

Moshi and the Kilimanjaro area offer fantastic nature but also the most unpleasant people and the biggest scamming I have ever witnessed and I have been to many 3rd world countries.​ Almost every place that is even remotely interesting requires you to buy a guide.​ Even if you dont need or want one.​ Very annoying and ruined a lot of experiences.​ Everything is catered to package tourists looking to spend thousands on ridiculously priced safaris. Individual tourism is not really cateres towards.

The level of the services provided is shocking all over Tanzania. Slow, inefficent, rude. At the same time you are seen as a walking ATM. Government charges fees for everything but gives nothing in return. 

Next problem: Tanzanian men have absolutly no respect towards women and behave in a way I can only describe as cave man like.​ Very unpleasant unless you are travelling alone as a man.​

So if you think you want to DN in Tanzania I would recommend to think twice.​"

question is in the title. I am a former construction business owner, technically I still am but have downsized. I had employees but since covid, I returned to college and the family farm while I have been attending online class for a business administration degree. I have also been self-educating on finances and investing more so than the average person. I am most likely going to continue my education after my associate degree as I will qualify for academic scholarships etc. My tech skills go as far as having good typing skills, a good writer/storyteller, and decent but not special word-based software skills such as Excel, PowerPoint, etc. the only type of job I am aware of in the digital nomad field (or even close to) would be some form of transcription work. But I was curious if my construction experience of being a division manager (I ran a stone division for a masonry company), and a business owner of a small construction company could assist in any type of ""work from a computer"" job. My lack of knowledge leads me to think it will not but figured I'd ask.

At this point, my cost of living is extremely low, and I do have time that I could add a temporary or part-time gig to my schedule to practice and gain skills. At a minimum, it would be great if I could make a few extra bucks to work from my computer as I am hoping to do a sizeable amount of low-cost traveling in late 2022 possibly 2023.

I don't really understand the process in full since I haven't gone for it yet and it sounds kinda scary.

I talked with my CPA and she said it's do-able but I should contact my employer. Then when I contacted my employer it sounded like they were not okay with the deal.

The only option I would have for going for it now is not contacting my employer but then I would probably be scared my employer would be notified by the IRS somehow and cause a potential termination.

Thinking about it though, the termination doesn't sound so bad as I would save myself 40-50k income tax and then I would be on unemployment benefits, but applying to a new job in that situation does not sound ideal so I'm leaning towards not applying for FEIE. However, this would be the worst case situation.

Perhaps a normal or good case situation would be my company being delighted they just netted money on my income tax, but I can't deny that they have a contract stating I would be outside the country working for more than 8 weeks.

Anyone here do it successfully? Mind sharing your situation? It sounds much easier with having your own business."

qplruj,dlmmc,Has anyone else started booking further in advance?,"Initially when I began this journey I just took a flight that I booked about a week or so out to PDC, Mexico and checked into a hostel when I arrived without booking ahead (September 2020). I didn't get into Selina because reception was closed but the next morning I moved over there to a 20 dorm which was basically a 4 dorm since it was half capacity and nobody was even there.

I've bought flights for the next day and accommodation same day in the year since since it hasn't really been to bad... I must have gotten pretty lucky in places like Croatia and Italy.

More recently I've noticed that it's become more and more difficult to find good deals closer to the date of departure/arrival. Obviously this is due to the decrease of restrictions across more and more countries but here I was a week ago trying to find cheap and good accomodation in Buenos Aires, Argentina and found that unless I was super flexible that there was almost nothing available. That and the fact that last minute international flights to/from that country are the worst but I went ahead and booked more than 3 weeks in advance which I have not done in a looong time.

Obviously this brings me worries like testing positive the day I take the test for the upcoming flights, etc. or host cancellations and all of that but I am also wondering about your experiences?

Here in Rio it was a terrible idea to wait until even a week out... I thought I'd find something better/cheaper but then I kind of screwed myself.

So... thoughts?"

>1. I think we’re on the verge of a revolution in travel  
>  
>2. Before the pandemic, most people were tethered to the place they worked because they had to go into an office   
>  
>3. The pandemic accelerated the mass adoption of technologies (like Zoom) that allowed millions of people (not everyone, but a large chunk) to work from home   
>  
>4. Suddenly, they were untethered from the need to work in specific places at specific times  
>  
>5. Millions of people can now travel anytime, anywhere, for any length — and even live anywhere    
>  
>6. All you have to believe is that Zoom is here to stay to believe this trend is here to stay   
>  
>7. This newfound flexibility is bringing about a revolution in how we travel

> 8. In recent months, some of the largest companies in the world, like Amazon, P&G, Ford, and PwC, have announced increased flexibility for employees to work remotely, and I expect more companies to follow

>9. We’re seeing this in our own data   
>  
>10. Travel anytime: Monday’s and Tuesday’s are our fastest growing days of the week for families to travel  
>  
> 11. Travel anywhere: over 100,000 towns & cities had a booking on Airbnb during the pandemic (6,000 places had their 1st booking)   
>  
>12. Live anywhere: between July and September, 1 in 5 nights booked were for a month or longer. This is our fastest growing category by trip length

qq7bq3,yeiz8,How to build muscle when you have no equipment as a digital nomad (Routine With Progressions),"I recently commented on a question that was asked here regarding staying in shape, so I figured I might as well turn it into a full-fledged post.

&#x200B;

As a digital nomad, it definitely can be a bit of a challenge to stay in shape while abroad, especially if you need to adjust to limited grocery and gym options.

&#x200B;

Sometimes gyms don’t offer short-term memberships or they may simply be outside of your budget. Then you’ll need to be creative with the equipment you *DO* have access to!

&#x200B;

Calisthenics will be a staple in your workout routine in this scenario. Depending on your respective goals, the way your workout is designed will differ.

&#x200B;

Below, I’ll describe an example of what a routine might look like that I give my clients that are traveling abroad and can’t really go to a proper gym.

&#x200B;

A general workout routine that is focused on gaining **strength and size** when you *don’t* have access to a gym might look something like this:

&#x200B;

|*Exercise*|*Sets*|*Reps*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Pull ups|3|8 - 12|
|Rows|3|8 - 12|
|Squats|3|8 - 12|
|Deadlifts|3|8 - 12|
|Push-ups|3|8 - 12|

&#x200B;

Now, everyone’s baseline strength level will differ. Therefore it is important to either make use of exercise variations or using equipment to make exercises easier. Below, I have listed both easier variations and a more difficult variations of each exercise. I’ll also link videos that show how to perform them.

Feel free to ask questions if anything is unclear, happy to help :)

# Resources

**Pull up variations**

Okay this one is a bit harder to do without equipment, but generally there should be a local playground, or even a stairwell where you can do some pull ups. Be creative here, because it is an important facet of back-training

qq90jl,cb6fsnse,Tired of Being Digital Nomad,"I am writing this just to vent. 

I had an amazing job some years ago that allowed me to work from home. I am no longer on that job but I have learned to move around and work “anywhere I want” for the past 4 years. It has been unstoppable traveling. People used to say to me that they were jealous, that I was so lucky, etc.

The reality is that I am tired, mentally and physically. I have attempted to settle down in some cities since the pandemic started with, unfortunately, not the best of results. 

Today an employer that was supposedly about to hire me for an office job as I want it, finally wrote to me (after 2 weeks of hearing nothing) that they offered the position to another candidate. I guess I am a little bit mad that they made me wait for the info. As I am used to the struggle I guess I repeat to myself “it’s no big deal, I’ll figure it out” again. One more attempt.

I have managed to regain energy to continue moving but it’s not my biggest wish. The truth is that I enjoy cooking broccoli and rice and staying for over a year in a place I could call home - moving messes up with my belongings, I often lose things on the way, can’t buy big stocks of groceries and can’t commit to annual gym passes. A cancellation fee is still waiting for me in some country from the last time I tried to commit.

It’s difficult to make friends (trustworthy friends/dependable)…and some other stuff. 

Anyway I know this falls in somewhat “first world problems” so high five if you find some sympathy on this. 

Cheers."

qrqp7i,5imo9,Hot take: I don't think Airbnb is that bad and their customer support solved my problem,"Hating on Airbnb seems to be a popular pastime of this sub. Ironically, I'm sure many of the people saying how much Airbnb sucks are doing so from the comfort of an Airbnb. So I thought I'd offer an alternative narrative based on my, albeit somewhat limited, experience. 

Last month, I was checking into a new stay in Tbilisi, Georgia. Literally as I'm turning the key to the apartment, a guy with a handful of syringes brushes past us into a open shared kitchen (this is an old Soviet-style building) directly next door and he proceeds to prepare for what I assume is shooting up heroin, ketamine, or whatever. 

So we decided to get the hell out of there and call the owner. He was sympathetic and understanding that we didn't want to stay there, but he noted that based on the cancellation policy we'd be paying for the first two nights regardless.

So began my interactions with support. I'll admit, it took a couple phone calls and more than an hour of my ""precious time."" Initially Airbnb said that I would get a refund of all but the first two nights plus Airbnb's service fee. I wasn't satisfied with that, so I pressed for a 100% refund, and after a day or so, I got it. Hurray for me. 

My point is, this experience seems par for the course in dealing with any large company's customer service. Other than that, I've had no issues. 

High prices are a common complaint, but it seems that's just the ""free hand of the market"" at work. Blame it on your fellow travelers who view staying in an Airbnb as a luxury, which it is.

Please share your thoughts."
qrr620,4fjcizo4,How many DNs think they have left their home country for good?,"I first left the US when I finished high school in Australia as an exchange student. A year after finishing Uni, I returned to Australia and worked and backpacked around there and NZ for a year and half. 

At that point I had the opportunity to immigrate but I was twenty-four and turned it down because basically giving up my family and country seemed too much. If not for having met my husband in Seattle when I was twenty-eight, I would say not immigrating was my biggest regret in life. 

But four years ago we became digital nomads and I felt like I finally got back to the life I was meant to have. When we left at the end of 2017, we suspected that except for visiting friends and family once a year, we wouldn't be returning full time to the clusterf\*ck that is America.

I'm in Roma Norte, and CDMX is pretty economical, I love the food, and haven't had any issues with mugging/thefts etc. The city seems to have pretty much opened up post Covid, there's lots to do including lots of Meetups, Couchsurfing stuff etc

Buenos Aires seems like a great place but I've got the sense that the opportunistic theft/pick pocketing is worse there. It seems quite a lot cheaper, especially if you're willing to mess around with taking in USD cash and selling at the unofficial, but real rate (which sounds like a bit of a pain to me, I'd really rather just use my card...) I had a look at Meetup and it's a bit of a ghost-town. Inflation is over 50% a year which seems a bit mad but I guess as long as it's not a financial crisis then that's business as usual.

qse2ud,3v19z9sy,Mexico Temporary Residency Roadblock,"I am currently in Merida, Yucatan with my 4 year old son on a tourist permit (until March '22). I have contacted the Tucson, AZ consulate regarding residency, to which they stated my self-employment income might only get me temp, not perm residency (which I'm fine with). I have a legal LLC, a business and personal bank accounts proving I make above the required minimum for income monthly, as well as a letter from my client of 2 years stating how much they pay for my services and that it is an open-ended contract. Additionally, I submitted my accounting invoices and payments for the past 6 months. All of the documents were emailed at the request of the consulate, since I'm out of the country. The answer was that in order to qualify, I have to have, ""35,000 USD in an account for one year,"" to qualify. Can anyone shed light on which direction to go? I make double per month what they are requesting, but it doesn't come from an outside employer, it comes from my own business. I am willing to fly to ANY consulate to handle this with ease. I cannot, however wait a year with the financial requirements they suggested at the Tucson consulate.  I don't have those funds and that would mean I would have to leave Mexico in March. I certainly can't save the money in the US with its high cost of living. I am also not willing to border hop, as the current immigration crackdown on this does not guarantee I will be able to return for another 6 months.

***Preface:*** *About a month ago me and my ex-GF decided(it was mutual indeed) to breakup after 6.5 year long relationship, so my mental state is a bit shaken and I think about my present/future life a lot. I love going to a bars and drinking in general, you already know where this is going... I went to BCN for a business trip. With a great timing after recent breakup, I decided to stay a bit longer and enjoy a single life in a foreign city.*

Being alone in BCN, I wanted to meet some people. I'm more on the introvert side of spectrum so making new friends is not easy for me. Inspired by a recommendation from this sub, I downloaded a Meetup app and went to a rooftop jazz concert. It was lovely. Beautiful weather, music & vermouth. The performance was amazing, met a bunch of lovely people, had interesting discussions. A 4 of us(none of us met each other before) decided to continue and go to some bar. The discussion went for a couple of hours before we exchanged telephone numbers and said goodbye.

At this point I was considering going home, but I decided to go for a dinner and another beer(did I mention I love beer?). I was having a really good time, but desperate for a more of human connection, I went to this great craft beer place with karaoke. After another two beers, I was confident enough to pick up the microphone myself. Had a great time, interacted with others, had couple of beers and did couple of other songs(which btw were a bit depressing, compared to the songs singed by the others). I even did a duet with some stranger.

At this point I definitely should have go home, but looking at my payment history, I had another drink in a different bar. Unfortunately my brain decided to stop recording to the memory, so I'm not really sure what was happening, but I was finally going home. The problem is, streets in BCN are very narrow. I guess it was around 3 AM so they were empty and dark as well... Using the maps on my phone, I guess I went with the shortest route instead of choosing some more populated one. Suddenly, at least 2 guys ran towards me. I guess I froze, they threw me to the ground and took my expensive phone and a wallet with my debit cards, documents and some small amount of cash. It was very turbulent/fast. I must have been very close to my place based on how much time it took me to go to the near police station on the la Rambla street. They were not able to help me. Disoriented and without maps on my phone, I wasn't even sure how to get to my place, but somehow I found it.

I had my older phone at my place, specifically for this occasion because I was warned BCN can be dangerous. This way I'm able to survive here, pay for stuff using apple pay and block the cards I had in my wallet. The robbers must have been amateurs, because they tried to use them at a fucking bakery and make an order on aliexpress for 30eur.

Luckily I'm ok. I had a slight pain in my hip as well as a bump on the back of my head(must have hit it when I fell to the ground). This experience ruined a bit me being for the first time in BCN. Older phone doesn't have as good camera(s), so I won't have great photos from now on. I'm also bit traumatized, so entering the narrow street where the entrance to my place is can be very scary at night.

**Here are some lessons:**

1. Had I been more responsible, not a drunk idiot, this could have been probably avoided.
2. Avoid empty streets / return home at a reasonable hour.
3. I'm much more likely to stay in a hotel instead of AirBnB next time, even though it's more expensive. In this case it'd have been worth it.
4. When booking a hotel/AirBnB, check its entrance, not just approximate location.
5. Have another phone as a backup.
6. There's no need to have all the documents and credit/debit cards on you. Leave them at your place. Especially your passport.
7. Before going to a police to report what happened, it's better to have a phone with a working number and data, so that you can provide them a way to reach you.
8. Find my iPhone isn't really that useful in this case. I know the address where my phone is, but police can do nothing with it. They can't just go to a building and knock on all the doors.

**TLDR:** Had an epic day, met a dozen of awesome and friendly people, got stupidly drunk and as I was returning back home somewhere around 3 AM, a couple of guys jumped me. They took my phone and wallet with my debit cards, cash and documents."

qsjo44,13ox9y5z,Wifi Situations,"Hi everyone, 

Just wondering how you handle wifi situations? We're in Ecuador right now and the wifi is pretty much shit everywhere (except mayyyybeee the major cities if you find someone who pays for the fast stuff, which is barely anywhere). 

Even when we pay for expensive places and have them run speed tests we seem to get there and the wifi is much slower than they claimed. Our work requires regular video calls on zoom.

We've been using 4g hotspot on our phones which works, but didn't expect to have to use it for everything. Now we're asking for 4g before booking as well but not everywhere has good cell service. We're leery to go anywhere without cell service now - for example our latest place promised good wifi, we get there and the speed test was sooooo slow even regular pages took time to load. 

Just wondering how you all handle having good wifi? Do you mostly use a hotspot? Do you only stay in cities? Do you ask the host to upgrade their wifi if it's a possibility for longer stays?

  
Thank you for any advice!!!"

When I sit down for Thanksgiving activities, I will have all of the love and support of the r/digitalnomad family in my head as I brush off shitty comments.

The best feedback I’ve gotten is “they don’t like your lifestyle? Fuck ‘em.” Still doesn’t feel good when your family treats you like shit during the holidays. But happy to report I am firmly in the “fuck ‘em” camp.

———

American nomad, 31F, unmarried, no kids, good finances, rock-solid 100k job with growth. Still in great shape, but single. Travel the country by car. I love my life and feel very fulfilled and good about myself.

Mother’s family is from the Midwest/south. I came back to a town in this area to spend Nov and early Dec to relax and save money with my parents. Parents have no issue with me coming back to stay. Also doing frequent trips to surrounding cities to see friends and using a coworking space here in town.

My aunts, uncles and cousins of various relation treat me like a loser. They’re condescending and judgmental. I learned to not talk about my travels unless prompted to and mostly listen to them. They keep insinuating in a backhanded way that I have no responsibilities. I have very few, but by choice and take care of them.

qssvyq,2ckmjcx,Do we follow sport because we are missing something?,"In my country football is like a religion. You MUST be a football fan to the point that lot of guys are veeeery sad if their team loses.

I have a theory about this:

- The more you watch football the more you have a flat, black and white life -

We like to enjoy the success of others because we are not able to create it ourselves.
We need someone to make something exciting happen for us because we have built a life that is all the same.
If we all had a full life, no one would have the need to cheer for someone (I mean die-hard fans. Beer with friends watching the game is not part of these cases)


For example right now I am visiting a foreign country for 4 months, and I have instantly stopped watching at sport results, because I simply don’t need them. I am creating an exciting life on my own and sporting results are now superfluous.




But I want to validate this theory of mine.
You are often traveling so probably you have a richer life than most people: what relationship do you have with cheering?

Are you agree with me?

What do you think about this?

Thanks a lot to everyone :)

qva3w5,1x15hdvr,"Is the new M1 MBP 16"" an overkill for my needs? Should I just get an M1 Air or go all in on the MBP 16""?","I'm a digital nomad and my needs performance wise are pretty basic. I don't need a whole lot of power for any creative work or coding. Power and performance wise, the M1 Air would 100% satisfy my needs.

However:

\- Being a nomad means that my laptop screen is basically my only screen. External monitors etc. are not feasible while traveling. Right now I'm on a Thinkpad X1 Carbon 14"" (this will be my very first MacBook), and the screen is already quite small. I'm almost positive I wouldn't want my screen to be any smaller (i.e. the 13.3"" M1 Air), and having more screen real estate would be actually really nice. Maybe not an absolute necessity, but I think it would make for a very different work environment. Since I'll be using the MacBook for many hours every day, the additional weight and size of lugging around the MBP and the additional investment is pretty well justified.

\- The 2nd biggest selling point of the MBP 16"" for me is the screen brightness. I'm on the road frequently, working from cafes, outdoors, etc., and 1000-nit peak brightness of the miniLED would be absolutely terrific. M1 Air has \~365 nits of brightness. My current Thinkpad has 469 nits. I wouldn't really want to go lower than what I currently have.

\- The ports on MBP 16"" are a really nice feature. As is the longer battery life. Again these aren't very critical as the M1 Air already has an extremely good battery life and I could probably get used to less ports coming off a Thinkpad. Also, M1 Air has no vents which is a noteworthy benefit in my book.

The main things that are making me hesitant to make the final purchase decision are the following:

\- MBP 16"" might just be an overkill for my needs (performance wise). Why lug around a 4.8 lb workstation that's way more expensive and is overall less portable, while I could probably get all my work done on the M1 Air? (Just with a smaller screen that might not be bright enough in some scenarios)

\- The price. I have no problems affording the MBP 16"", but it's always a factor. Especially if the laptop gets stolen or damaged, etc. (it's always gonna be a little more to worry about)

Also, I've never used an iPad (still new to the whole Apple ecosystem, just got an iPhone 2 months ago and loving it), but here's an idea. Since 80% of use cases for the MacBook will be to carry it to and from a coworking space in a backpack - where the added weight and size don't really matter that much, I could perhaps get an iPad + keyboard at some point in the future for the other 20% of my use cases, which is when I like something ultra portable to bang out some work or writing while on the go. I'd assume that having an MBP 16"" + iPad w/ keyboard would offer a lot more versatility than just having an M1 Air. Conversely, if I got the M1 Air, I'd probably have way less incentives to get an iPad down the line (for better or for worse - less versatility but also way more minimalistic and helps to keep my carry-on backpack weight lower).

Overall, I'm leaning more towards the MBP 16"" for that sweet screen real estate, brightness, and also superior webcam. But I wanted to hear out any other perspectives on making this choice.

Looking at their website, it looks like you need to open a brokerage account, and then you can get a linked checking account with an ATM card.  I see the *Schwab* Bank Visa Platinum *Debit Card*mentioned.  Is there a yearly fee for the ATM card?

Is there anything else I need to know before I open an account?

Thanks!"
qvcm0w,4fjcizo4,What the Hell is Going on with the Price of Airbnbs? (And What Can You Do About It?),"I think most of us here can agree that accommodations are one of the most important factors in a nomad's life. 

And based on what people have been writing about, Airbnb has become a hot topic of conversation of late. So hot in fact we wrote an entire article about it. We talked to some travel experts, some frequent Airbnb users and others to try and understand what is going on. (Airbnb declined to be interviewed.)

The article is in two parts, the first part being all about why Airbnbs have become so seemingly expensive compared to what they used to cost. 

The TL:DR answer?  

1) Covid which cratered the travel sector and forced a lot of Airbnb owners to switch to long-term rentals. When travel started to come back this year, there was a much more limited supply of Airbnbs. 

Covid also accelerated a switch to remote work. Many more workers now know it's feasible and want to stay permanently out of the office. And they are bidding up prices. 

2) Airbnb is no longer a plucky start-up trying to lure in customers but a publicly-traded company focused on increasing profits and employing sophisticated algorithms to drive up those prices. And more owners are either passing on the fees they pay to Airbnb to customers, or hiding them in things like the cleaning fee. 

3) A booming economy (for some). The rich got richer during the pandemic and didn't have many places to spend all that money. Now that the world is opening back up, they're spending it on travel. 

 Does this make Airbnb evil? No, it makes them a business that usually provides a pretty good product, which is often superior to what hotels offer -- kitchens, proper bedrooms, tens of thousands of unique locations in fantastic places around the world, and a lot of convenience. Which is why people are willing to pay what Airbnb is charging. 

Will prices drop back to what nomads were enjoying a few shorts years ago? Almost certainly not. 

Which most nomads, including us, find to be a giant pain in the ass. Figuring out our next destination after Prague took more effort than anything else in the past four years. (Though part of that was rising Covid rates around Europe.)

But we've done some research and come up with strategies that can help nomads get better deals, including how to negotiate with hosts, how to better calculate those hidden fees so you better know what you're paying, how to find better valued properties the Airbnb algorithm might be hiding from you, how to find Airbnb properties on other sites, and more. 

However, please note, that information is behind our paywall as this newsletter is how we make our living. The vast majority of our content is free and readily available but some of it is premium, which is what our subscribers pay for. 

Some of you may very well have figured it all out for yourselves. But I know I sure learned some surprising things. 

FWIW, we use Airbnb way less than we used to. Now it's mostly Booking and as things get a little more normal we're going to start doing coliving again, which we really miss.

qvkf84,4aicf,Why don't co-working spaces provide monitors and keyboards?,"If I'm traveling into a foreign city as a digital nomad and I work full time at a computer..   I'm going to prefer a decently ergonomic desk and chair with a computer monitor, USB-C docking station, keyboard, and mouse.

Yet it seems nearly zero co-working spaces offer this simple setup.   Instead there's either just tables with probably uncomfortable chairs and usually terrible harsh lighting, where I'm expected to work from a tiny laptop screen all this time.. often while I'm being blinded by unfiltered lights, sun coming through windows without blinds, etc.  Or option B is an expensive private office space with maybe with a desk but certainly with no computer monitor or other equipment.

Therefore, if I'm just working for 1 or 2 weeks in a random foreign city before traveling to the next place.. In order to just a have the bare minimum for a comfortable desk setup, I'm expected to purchase a computer monitor for this private office and lug it there on mass transit, etc.  I mean really?  Why is it so complicated to simply offer what every traveling full time computer person would want for even the most basic comfortable work setup in order to do 40+ hours a week without developing migraines, eye strain, neck pain, and back pain?  It is not rocket science to just have some desks with monitors, docking station, keyboard, mouse, etc.  It is absolutely maddening to me.

So why are work spaces with a computer monitor and keyboard so uncommon in co-working spaces?  It would make all the difference when traveling."
qvo4xu,b30tomn,My experience with safety wings health insurance,"Hi guys, just wanted to share my experience with Safety wings health insurance.

It all started when I had to go to the dentist, because I started having an strong pain on one of my teeth, the bill was just 15$ as not much had to be done and I thought, even if is a very small amount of money it would be perfect to test how good the safety wings service is.

So, I went to the website to make the claim and realised that safety wings is not the actual company that provides you with the health insurance, is just a frontend for sales, they don't offer you more than a modern looking page for payments and for chat. The chat is pretty much worthless as the only thing they do is redirect you to the company that privides you with the insurance, which is called WorldTrips.

So, got redirected to WorldTrip, which website is like a 80s - 90s horrible piece of crap where you have to register again even if you registered in safety wings, and then, to submit your claim, you need to fill a massive pdf form with millions of questions, most of them unrelated to your query.

So, I filled the form, and nothing happened during a couple of weeks, not even an acknowledgement of someone reviewing the case.

Wondering what is going on, I sent them an email asking how is my case going and week later, they replied saying they are missing a document with the bill, so I send it back to them. Again, a lot of days go by and I receive another email saying they have received the bill and they will take between 1 to 2 months to give me a veredict.

So, to summarise:

1. Safetywings is just an intermediary taking a cut just for providing you with a fancier UI to register and pay for the insurance, they are totally useless in the case of a claim.
2. You are going to have to wait forever to get the money back from the insurance if you actually get it back, and are going to provide documentation until you get bored.I am happy I tested it with this small 15$ issue, because if I find myself in this kind of situation on a serious expensive injury, like falling from a motorbike or something like that, I would be  fumming.

Conclusion:

I sent them an email, telling them they can shove the 15$ up their arse and cancelled subscription"

qvx8ka,ela26fp0,Are there any legitimate travel insurance options for nomads?,"I've been looking into getting 'nomad' travel insurance, and I've been down this road before without any real luck... 

I'm from the UK, and it seems that most insurers:   


1. Require a return flight to your home destination. 
2. Limit trips to 60 days, even on multi-trip policies. After this, you're required to return home before going on another trip. 

I have seen some specialist nomad insurers:

1.  WorldNomads - which don't cover the sports I require (surfing/freediving) and also seem to not cover change of trip (amongst many other things). 
2. SafetyWing - a new US-based company. It has a great brand and signup experience which I almost fell for, but seems to be a front for another company and offers a really low level of cover, no gadget insurance, no luggage loss etc.

My only option appears to be to rely on the contents insurance for the apartment I own in the UK, which will cover belongings lost/stolen overseas, and then to try and find some sort of medical cover for serious emergencies. Reading the reviews, and from previous experience, it seems as though it simply isn't worth claiming unless your medical bills are a huge amount of money because it's such a drawn-out process.

I really can't find any other feasible option. Is this really all there is?"
qvzp45,c4e4lipy,[Free Chrome Extension] After a 6mo road trip I built a Chrome extension to help you find Airbnbs equipped for remote work. Would love some feedback!,"&#x200B;

This past New Year, my girlfriend and I broke our apartment lease and took off on a 6-month road trip for our first ever DN experience (long time lurkers of r/digitalnomad on my personal though). We spent a month staying at Airbnbs in Lake Tahoe, San Diego, Seattle, Las Vegas, SW Utah, and Honolulu.

&#x200B;

We had an incredible trip, but finding a home that had fast, reliable Wifi and comfortable workspaces was time-consuming and difficult. After interviewing dozens of other DNs, I realized this was a problem every remote worker staying on Airbnb faces.

&#x200B;

So, I decided to build a Chrome Extension called Offie to make it easier for both new and experienced nomads to find the best Airbnbs to work from.

&#x200B;

Offie works seamlessly with Airbnb by taking Wifi and workspace information from the listing page and bringing it to the search page. No more wasting time looking through photos and getting excited about a listing, only to realize the Wifi is slow!

&#x200B;

Current Offie features include the following information from a listing:

* 📶 Wifi speed test results
* 🖥️ Dedicated workspace amenities
* ✅ Sentiment analysis on reviews mentioning Wifi

&#x200B;

We've got some cool projects in the backlog too:

* Image recognition to show photos of potential workspaces
* Historical speed test data for the neighborhood
* Crowdsourced speed test + workspace reviews

&#x200B;

[Offie is available to download for free from the Chrome store today.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/offie-airbnb-wifi-reviews/hhookjglfpdjgdmgdaippnmgciafbfbd)

Would love to get feedback on other useful features, and I'm happy to answer any questions!

qxdtiq,6c0y3tb5,"I'm a freelancer, so why am I working from home? Looking for advice on starting a digital nomad lifestyle","I've always wanted to be a digital nomad, but I keep holding myself back thinking that I'm not ""ready"" or ""successful enough"" yet.

I've been doing freelance graphic design for about two years now and I've built up a pretty consistent client base that makes me a decent income. I work half the hours that my husband does, yet I make double his salary.

I'm actually already living abroad as well, I moved from the US to London about three years ago, to start a life with my husband here (he's a citizen). We chose London over any city in the US for the potential and prospect of easy, cheap travel. In the same amount of time and a quarter of the price, you can experience an entirely different culture and country where, for the same expenditure, you'd just land yourself in a neighboring state in the US.

Unfortunately, we haven't really traveled that much at all over the past few years as for the first one, we were young and broke (I actually did the most travel at that time ironically, without my husband), and then the pandemic hit which made travel near-impossible up until now.

I keep waiting for my husband to be available to travel, or to be ""ready"" or at ""the right point in my career"" or for a specific opportunity to present its self, like a client or project that actually requires me to travel for work (when is that ever really going to happen again honestly).

But, what the hell am I waiting for if I'm only working at my own desk in my own home because I choose to? Pre-pandemic I always set myself up at a coffee shop in London, but it really could have been any coffee shop in the world for all that it matters. I think the difficulty now I suppose is trying to find a place to work while traveling as it isn't as easy or comfortable anymore with the regulations and anxiety.

I think my main barriers aside from my perspective are -

* **Financial commitments:**
   * My husband and I have a pooled income, I would feel bad if my decision to travel while working took away from the finances that are available to him (although his company would pay for work-outings), or took away from our **savings goals as a couple** (we're still planning our wedding reception, we need various new household items, things that we want from our joint-wishlist, etc.)
   * **Rent**. It isn't like I'd be able to sublease my half of our studio apartment while I'm away. We have an amazing flat and my husband would be living / working there regardless of where I am. I wouldn't want to downsize or downgrade our home because it's something we both really love and we worked hard to find.
   * **Expenses aborad**. I definitely have a lot of research to do before pursuing the lifestyle but I can foresee this being a limiting factor. I suppose that the digital nomad lifestyle doesn't have to look like a continuous, all-in luxury vacation, but is it possible to keep your cost of living down to near, or under your normal cost of living at home?
* **Visa requirements:**
   * Per my spouse visa, **there's a cap to the amount of time that I can spend outside of the UK per year** until I'm eligible for the next tier. I believe it's something generous like four months, but I usually spend a month in the US over the summer visiting friends and family, and I'd want to reserve a month for any family emergencies, **that only leaves about 8 weeks** for additional travel, some of which I'd take with my husband and family here.
   * My other concern would be visa requirements at my destination, but, it's relatively easy to get around that as a digital nomad and a freelancer from what I understand.
* **Traveling alone / as a woman:** I know that it's the 21st century and tons of women do this, I'm not particularly nervous about going somewhere new alone, I'm more so concerned about what ways it could limit me. For instance, I like going to bars, clubs, and experiencing nightlife, something that's riskier to do as a woman on her own. -- I also want to experience new places with friends, travelling alone can be magical but I want to create shared memories. Going it alone can be lonely, London was lonely for the first year and a half before our friends moved here and our social circle grew, I'm kind of over being alone at this point in my life. None of our friends are currently in the position to travel while working at the moment, everyone aside from me is tied to a job locally.

Some of these things are easier to get over than others. Maybe I'm not ""ready"" or at ""the point in my career"" where I should take up this lifestyle... or am I? I don't feel like I need to go all-in and travel 99% of the time, I think that I'd want to spend two or three weeks here or there, several times throughout the year.

What ducks should I have in order before deciding to go nomad? What do you need to sacrifice in order to keep your living expenses similar to what they would be at home? In what ways can I make the experience more social? Are there groups that I can join, or a co-working membership to a space that's meant for digital nomads? How do you know when you're ""ready""!"

* Don’t do a startup.
* Specialise in something that every company likes a lot. Avoid niche tech, go for huge popular things (eg. AWS, JS, Python, React).
* Take a $ 500-1000 / day, full-remote job (If you don’t know how to find them, there’s a chapter about it).
* Don’t live in big cities (go for smaller, more liveable towns).
* Leave any job that requires too much work or too many meetings. Meetings are the mind-killer. You’ll quickly find another gig because you specialized.
* Take 2 months for holidays in-between contracts.
* Do this for 7 years while investing most of your salary in a diversified portfolio. Don’t go too crazy with Crypto.

One of my career goals finally happened and I am able to do full time remote with a low 6 figure salary. The only catch at this time is that I have to live in the US.

I have no idea what I'm doing, and I'll be traveling with my fiance (and senior cat). We are thinking of traveling across the US (from DC area) to check out some cities over the next couple years.

I am looking for any guidance that pertains to the digital nomad life in the US. Thanks everyone

Edit: thanks everyone for their inputs so far! We seriously have no idea what to consider, so things like the hotel credit card idea are certainly items we love to learn. 

For those suggesting Vanlife, I appreciate it. But we are looking to stay in actual residences, Apts, etc. Averaging probably 1-3 months for our visits."
qxxu3b,16wxs1,US Resident Traveling to Canada for a Week,"I’ve decided that I’d like to take a somewhat spontaneous trip to Canada. I might leave as early as tomorrow. I’d spend a week in Montreal and maybe visit Quebec City too. 

If I left for Canada tomorrow, would I need to inform my employer? Would they know I’m in Canada? If yes, is it a big deal? I’d imagine tax considerations might be an employer’s concern. 

A little background - I’m an accounting manager. I work for one of the largest advertising companies in the world. 

Simply put, if you wanted to work from another nearby country for a week, how would you communicate this to your employer? Or would you communicate it all, given the potential administrative burden?"

I’m currently in Medellin and sadly won’t be coming back to Colombia in the new year because of crime & general feelings that it’s not safe. I live in a “safe” neighborhood, laureles, and there was a robbery at gunpoint in front of my apt building the other night. 

In general I’m kind of tired of Latinoamérica, the noise and female harassment, safety issues, etc. So that obviously rules out a lot of DN options. Mexico is out as well, been a DN there twice already and not really keen to go back. 

Southeast Asia still seems relatively complicated with COVID & visas and everything. I know Bali is kind of unrealistic (quarantine in Jakarta for Americans, can only go to ‘green zones,’ etc.) Thailand is a consideration, but honestly I lived in Vietnam for 11 mos and didn’t really like the culture, so I feel it’d be similar? 

This leaves Europe on the table, as I’ve thought of Portugal but the big problem is the visa. Only like 3 months, then I’d have to spend 3 months out of the EU if I wanted to come back right? 

Finally, I would consider just staying in the US but financially it would be super tight. I would probably have to get a car as well, which I just can’t do right now money wise. I have student loans that will kick back into repayment in Jan & don’t need a car loan. I also do love to travel and know I would get bored in a few months. 

Arghh, can anyone offer advice? I’m feeling very lost and unsure of where to go."

I always feel pretty nauseated when I visit a place like Chichen Itza, Cancun, 5th ave in Playa del Carmen. I can't really justify it or put words to it.

I think its because Americans like to assume the world revolves around us lol, so when we read Europeans discussing ""tax residency"" here, we think that advice applies to us. It doesn't.

The US has no concept of tax residency. A US citizen must pay taxes no matter what. The US tax policy is based on citizenship, not residency. And the IRS WILL pursue this. It's not something you can just let slide. Pay your taxes. All Americans must file a tax return every year no matter what. If you live abroad and plan never to return, if you've never even been on US soil, if you have no job. Doesn't matter. You must file a tax return. Even if you owe 0$, you must file a tax return. The policy is to help the IRS catch rich people trying to avoid their taxes abroad. "

qzhi3u,qx7n1,Music production as a side gig while traveling,"Hey all!

I'm currently working full-time as a software developer, but I've set a goal for myself to go remote part-time and begin traveling permanently around Spring 2023, and monetize a few of my projects/hobbies to make up for the difference in salary.  One is app development (I already have a few in the works), which is fairly straightforward as far as business models go, but I've also been producing music on and off for the past 7 or so years, and would really like the chance to take that to the next level.  Since I'm planning on traveling mostly in cheap CoL areas I don't need to earn a ton, my goal is about $400 per month from each of those gigs with roughly 10 hours per week on average invested in each, which I think is achievable after a year of preparation.

Now, I don't have any delusions about being able to make any decent amount on my music in the traditional sense; building a fanbase and monetizing the pittance you get from streaming services in barely over a year definitely isn't realistic.  However, there's plenty more opportunities out there, from the research I've done selling music for licensing (on online platforms, to video creators and such) is a good path.  I've found videos like [this one](https://youtu.be/BJD_BSS0SLs) which more or less claim it's the most profitable way to produce music, but they're light on the practical details I'm looking for.

So my question is, is selling music for licensing the most profitable way to be a part-time producer?  If it is, what are the best online platforms to do business through, and what genres are the most in-demand? I think of myself as fairly flexible, and with some experience I could more or less work with any genre.  If there's other work with similar flexibility where I get to apply some sort of musical creativity, I'd be more than open to that as well."

Not sure how long I'll stay in Mexico but the USA trip will probably happen in winter months, so I'm going to have to stick to warmer parts since I didn't pack winter clothes.

So I'm thinking the California coast. I'd love to hear your suggestions and let me know what you think about this rough itinerary with sights/areas I've been recommended or read about.

I'm not sure how long I want to make this trip. Mainly because it's going to hurt my wallet _a lot_. Thoughts?

- I'd fly to Tijuana and cross the border to San Diego on foot. Now, first of all: doing this, bad idea or good idea? I know Tijuana has an awful rep but I've been trying to inform myself and it seems as long as you stay in the touristy areas, act like a human and don't cross the border at night you'll be fine. Is crossing the border from Tijuana on foot messy, long lines? Let me know!

- San Diego (3-4 days). Gaslamp district, Mission beach/Pacific beach area.

- LA (1-2 weeks). Your usual touristy stuff: downtown and the old part, Hollywood Walk of Fame, Rodeo Drive, Venice beach, Santa Monica. 

- Santa Barbara (3-4 days). I've heard it's a beautiful place to chill. Malibu is on the way. Worth visiting?

Then onto NorCal. Hopefully the weather will be bearable.

- Monterey (2-3 days). Aquarium.

- Santa Cruz (2-3 days). Boardwalk.

- San Francisco (1-2 weeks). Lombard St, Alcatraz, Chinatown, tech companies headquarters. Golden Gate Bridge obviously.

Thoughts? Suggestions in general?

- Best transportation choices both within the city and between cities? I can't drive, so unfortunately renting a car just isn't an option.

- What areas would you recommend I stay in these places? And which ones to avoid? Mind that I'm stil trying to break the ""European safety bubble"" where virtually every corner is safe. I'm aware in the US you have to be a bit more careful around certain areas and at certain times. So could you please help me out with this?

Thank you very much!

PS: I've also read a suggestion about staying in Fresno and going to Yosemite. I'm not particularly huge on nature trips but I think I'd lose it on Yosemite. Not sure if viable without a car or no equipment/clothes (no idea what I'd need or how visiting the park ""works"")."

Firstly, what are the COVID restrictions like? (I'm Canadian and fully vaccinated). I've read that I do not need any test to enter Ireland. I've also read that Europe has a vaccine passport that's needed for some places. Does this also include Ireland and the UK? Will my Canadian vaccination app be ok?

Do you normally book your accommodations well in advance? Or is it fairly easy to decide last minute you want to travel to a new city and book the day of?

Also curious about the wifi on the airplane. Is it worth it to purchase so I can work while I fly? Or is it better to just do whatever work I can offline and wait till I land and find reliable wifi. I do accounting stuff and I will be doing some classes for school.

We booked flights from Vienna to Split, Croatia, through Travelgenio. (FYI, we don't normally use 3rd party travel booking sites, but for some reason we decided to give it a try.)

We got a price that seemed a bit better than what we got elsewhere, so we booked it. 

And when we got our bill, instead of it being $330, it was almost $500. After some investigating, we discovered that we'd been charged in British pounds, instead of USD, which is what the price had been showing in the whole time. 

We tried booking another flight to see what happened and sure enough, at the final step, the website switched the price from USD to the pound. You could change it back if you noticed but if you didn't, boom, your ticket price just shot up by 33%.

Looking online Travelgenio has a TERRIBLE reputation, which we should've investigated before booking our ticket.

We’ve also wired money via chase (my bank account) which costs 40 bucks every time we do it so don’t love that. 

Can we send what I get paid through PayPal each month? Are there issues with that tax wise/immigration wise? Thanks for any help/answers! I tried looking around for this question but couldn’t find anything super straightforward with my situation."

Usually, I stay a few weeks to a month in each place. I want to start traveling as lightly as possible. Thought it was time to invest and try to get a good bag to use on my adventures.

***My thoughts:***

I'm currently traveling using an old 50L backpack from Decathlon which is where I put my clothes & yoga mat. All my electronics & anything else that can fit goes inside a second small backpack I have, which fits under airplane seats. I'm looking to replace both of my backpacks and maximize my space and travel as lightly as possible. I'm thinking to have one bigger backpack be my checked bag when flying which will contain my clothes, yoga mat, and any other non-fragile stuff. The second backpack would be for all my electronics and other things that will fit inside. Ideally, this could fit under an airplane seat. Any suggestions for backpacks? Should I upgrade to a 55L or 60L and what do you suggest as a smaller second backpack for electronics? How many liters? What brands & models? It would be nice to just have them both as carryons, but sometimes checking in the bag is cheaper than another carry-on.

r19axo,og312,"Thinking of Moving to Thailand, need some advice.","Hey everyone,

So me (29) and my gf (25) plan to move to Thailand for 1 to 2 years. We are currently visiting the country , we stayed in Phuket , Chiang Mai and Bangkok and we kinda really liked Chiang Mai, however we have been reading about the smoke season and that was kind of a turn off.


To give a little bit more context, I personally am a freelance working as a Network Architect, we live in Dublin but work remotely for a French company, so I'll keep doing that. My gf has her contract ending in June 2022 and will be able to start fresh from there, either try to find a job in the same area or if it's too difficult , try to do remote courses to be able to unlock new possibilities whenever we come back in Europe.

We obviously are thinking about the visa issues , so maybe doing visa runs once or twice or sign up for an ED visa. 

Now comes the difficult choice of 'where?'

So as I was saying we really liked Chiang Mai, it has everything we like.

- As vegetarian we found so many restaurants really easily.
- There are some nice places to go for a walk ( Nimman One for example ).
- Nice Hipster cafés here and there, and a chill vibe compared to Bangkok. 
- And there are pretty big Malls for whenever we need something.
- Hiking in the mountains was great ! 

However the smoke season was a huge turn off. 

Bangkok is a big no no for both of us, way too loud , crowded , impossible to walk anywhere (we like to walk outdoor , I know Thailand is not the best place for that but... Yeah Bangkok especially was aweful for that ) , tons of Mall which we particularly don't care about (although icon Siam was nice )

Now comes Phuket , we personally didn't feel like we could live there. The tours to the islands especially with no tourist was something incredible but we didn't feel like living here as it didn't have that more established feeling kinda thing that Chiang Mai has. 
Also I can imagine that during normal time everything will be crowded with tourist.
Finding food was not as easy for us as everything has either meat or seafood. 

We also heard about other places like Bang Tao, Krabi, Rawai , but since we did not go there we don't know what to expect.

Also when it comes to accomodations we are looking for modern serviced appartements, with pool & gym.

And as you could've guessed from what we wrote we like : 

- Hipster Vibe ( helps for finding vegetarian food otherwise I don't care ont bit for Hipster stuff ) 
- Nice café places to chill
- Outdoor Walking 
- Nature
- A little bit of Modern feeling without being too crowded.

What do you reckon would be a good place in Thailand for that ? ( If you think it's 'none' that's also an answer and we might need to think of another country. )

Also as to why we chose Thailand : 
We wanted to experiment a bit of a culture shock in another country, but with all restrictions we had very little choices and ended up in Dublin, so now that things are going back to normal slowly we want to think about what's next and maybe experiment the culture shock we were thinking about :) 
initially we were thinking of Vietnam (because I am half viet so it would have been a nice opportunity to relink with my origins) but since it was (and I think mostly still ) closed, we decided to give Thailand a try since the cost of living seems pretty similar ( obviously more expensive ) , and if we end up there we will be able to explore the rest of SEA. 


Thank you if you have read this far :)


EDIT : Just adding that , neither me of my gf know how to drive a motorcycle, we both know how to drive a car though but it feels not like the most optimal way to move in Thailand lol. We are pretty scared of trying to learn motorcycle in Thailand, and we both dont really like motorcycles at all, but we understand we might have to at some point."

r1zo06,f4c68tpl,New Initiative to Support Digital Nomads Working Remotely from Greece,"Excerpt from the article below, sounds like Greece are really doubling down on their existing nomad strategy. 

Speaking during a panel discussion at the Next is Now conference, WIND Corporate Communication Executive Director **George Tsaprounis** gave some details on the upcoming initiative.

“Telecom-wise we will have special packages to be offered to the digital nomads who will choose to work remotely from these cities (Ermoupolis, Heraklion, Kalamata). We will provide them with services and products, including a very fast connection,” Tsaprounis said, adding that the special packages for digital nomads will include **backup systems**.

“For example, if you have a stable connection with 100Mbps or 200Mbps, mobile internet will also be included in case there is a problem and this way you can carry on working,” he said.

#### Special card for privileges

Moreover, Tsaprounis said that a close cooperation is needed with the state – to provide incentives to digital nomads – for the initiative to be a success.

We also need the private sector to set up **specific services and products** for them and, most importantly, we also need the local government to **simplify procedures, to provide discounts at restaurants**, etc,” he said.

WIND’s corporate communication executive said that the pilot phase of the initiative announced by Minsiter Kikilias includes a **special card**.

“When digital nomads in these three cities show this card, they will be provided with specific privileges,” he informed.

Tsaprounis added that in 2020 the number of digital nomads boomed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and that people still choose such a work lifestyle.

“Greece has only to win from this initiative,” he said"

I recently stayed in a hostel during time off, and it made me realize how much I miss having that type of instant community.  I want to try finding a co-living place next, hopefully designed for digital nomads.  But I'm not sure how to find a good one.

We've done a lot of research and looked into what others' experiences have been but we're still struggling to make a final decision. We are planning on going to 2 cities during our time down there, renting AirBnb's, and will likely be taking a handful of weekend/day trips in somewhat close proximity to where we stay. We like to exercise at the gym, hike, and generally try new things, which is at the root of our difficulty in deciding given the options at hand.

*Our options so far:*

**Buenos Aires-** we've heard great things about the city including the climate, cost of living, quality of life, the food scene, great internet connectivity. We've heard Palermo and Recoleta as the best areas to stay in and that the city has great infrastructure for getting around including city bikes and metro. I've gotten the impression that it's safer than Rio and other parts of Brazil but the bad areas in the south and southwest can be avoided otherwise. Healthcare seems to be pretty decent, second best along with Montevideo in the continent. I've read from some posters that they don't recommend Argentina at the moment but it seems to be conflicting with others' advice. Seems to have a lot of coworking options.

**Cuenca-** I had never heard of this Ecuadorian city until we began looking into DN destination in SA and have been pleasantly surprised to hear how many people have had positive experiences with it. The healthcare, QOL, affordability, temperature, and safety all seem fantastic. The only downside seems to be the remoteness of the place where going on a few weekend trips may be difficult but Cajas National Park and Sanguay NP are close by. There only seem to be a couple of coworking spots in the city.

**Santiago-** A lot of positives here as well, with one of the best infrastructures in SA, best healthcare from the cities I'm considering, safe, great climate, affordable, and many weekend destinations in Valparaiso, Vina del Mar, Mendoza, and Pucon. The biggest difference I'm sensing between Santiago and BA is that it's a bit less exciting by comparison in terms of flair and aliveness. Also, I've heard some civil unrest as of the past couple of years with protests and movements happening, as well as a big political election in December, although I'm not sure if that would impact us if we keep to ourselves.

**Sao Paolo-** I wasn't sold on Brazil initially and still have some doubts but I am learning new things about it and it's still under consideration. It seems to be a bustling metropolis with plenty of opportunities to work remotely and enjoy a high quality of life. Also easy to get around to other parts of the country/continent with quick flights from the airport. My biggest reservation with Brazil has been safety, considering we would be carrying our iPhones, Macbooks, etc with us, we wouldn't want to get robbed, which I know can happen anywhere but would prefer to limit our vulnerability if we can.

**Florianopolis-** Another city I had not heard of before and have been pleasantly surprised reading about it. It seems to go about at a more relaxed pace compared to Rio and Sao Paulo with better healthcare and safety by comparison. I'm not sure what could be the downsides to it besides it being a bit more remote than Rio and Sao.

**Montevideo-** From what I've read, this is the most progressive metro in SA with high safety, socially liberal, high QOL, clean air and parks, healthcare and the best internet services around. The main downside seems to be the cost of living being pricier than others on the list. Short day/weekend trips to BA or Punta del Este seem like good options. Otherwise the city seems chill albeit a bit boring compared to BA.

Any comments or suggestions from those living or having experienced any of these areas would be greatly appreciated."

I like the six figures situation that tech provides. Remote work seems to be normalized. That's great. 

However, tech companies seem to prefer US timezones. You know, the ubiquitous 9am standup and what have you - how'd you even make it if it's 10pm your time?

I'd be curious to know if there's a trick to finding companies that are ok with distributed workforces like that, even if the comp is on the lower end."
r4osch,6guzy,Video chat: a cure for loneliness,"I've been meeting my social quota by scheduling teachers on [iTalki](https://www.italki.com) and then chatting with them like I would a friend. They think I'm a bit weird, since the platform is intended for language lessons, not to just chat, but they're happy to chat too and they often learn something useful during the conversation.

Each lesson is around $7 and many of the people speak excellent English. For me the money is nothing compared to the cost of loneliness. I've met a lot of interesting people on there, learned about different cultures and places. Even if I settle in one location and make friends in person, I'd still like to talk to people on iTalki just because they're interesting.

One might ask, ""why not schedule meetings with people for free? Why pay people?"" That certainly is another viable option and maybe people on this forum have done so. I find I like paying people to talk because it is easier for me to cancel the lesson since I still pay them for their time. I don't feel like I let someone down as much if they're still being paid. Even a friend back home might get peeved if I cancelled on them.

Has anyone tried something like this? Maybe not through iTalki, but another platform, like a virtual chatroom?

Oh I also want to mention that even if you aren't lonely you might have other reasons to talk with someone through a platform like iTalki. It makes travelling to a new city much easier if you can ask someone questions about it over video chat first. I also found a guy who was trained as a cook in Mexico so he taught me a lot about Mexican cuisine. People on iTalki have various skills, like playing music, or something else, so it's an easy and (if you're living in the US) comparatively cheap way to learn a new skill or topic."

This inspired me to also go into tech and get a remote job, which I will do after I get my social work bachelor degree.

I like being creative, drawing, designing and can already work a little with illustrator, so that's why I would choose this bachelor program in digital design and development.

I was wondering however, if there are a lot of possibilities for remote jobs in that field.

I'm not yet a nomad, but I've been following this sub for a while now. I've seen a few ""trending"" tech companies hiring software devs, and I'm considering going full remote more and more...

One of my biggest questions right now is, how does it usually work when it comes to work contract, health insurance, retirement plans, etc... ? Do you get hired through a local branch? Do you get a work contracts from the company's country? And if you do, how do you manage to get health insurance and retirement savings in your home country? I assume every company/country would be different of course...

The laws in my country (France) favors the employee (health insurance, unemployment money, some level of protection against getting fired...) that I'm afraid I won't get if I work for a company based in the US. I would hate to leave my job for a remote company, only to get fired a few weeks/months later for whatever reason.

How do you guys deal with this?"

r5oyw8,f4c68tpl,Travel in 2022: what trends are the experts seeing?,"Excerpt from a Times UK article

FAR FLUNG DESTINATIONS

“Flexible working is also definitely having an impact on how our customers choose to holiday. They want to maximise their time and work-life balance, and can see the recuperative benefits of taking a ten-day trip where they relax for a week and work from their holiday hotel instead of home or the office for the last three days. There is a growing trend to spend accumulated savings on experiences with family and friends rather than material goods.”

AN END TO BUSINESS FOCUSED HOTELS

We’re obviously going to give up our cell and now I have now idea where to start when it comes to changing my number for the 2 step process.

Also for VPN, i pretty much need access to our business’ social media, CRM and bank accounts.

My question is, what did you guys do before moving? Is google port a good option? Which VPN is the best and shoud i buy it while I’m still in the US or wait till we move?

Sorry about the barrage of questions but these are the things that keep me up at night 😩

Thanks in advance and thanks for reading 🙏🏼

Edit: Thanks for the tips everyone! I actually don’t know if I needed VPN that’s why I asked but every comment was super helpful. 

I went and got NordVPN anyway since they have a cyber Monday special- 72% off

From What I’ve gathered, VPN can actually make internet speeds go faster and using it to get cheaper rates for purchasing anything for online?

We’re going to probably go with google voice and switch while we’re still here too

I'm not in to partying, but rather healthy living, so any small place that has a yoga community or something would be of interest.

So, basically I'm living in Mexico and I'm being offered a job-based in Talinn, Estonia as a Data Analyst. They are offering to cover all the relocation expenses and extra support for my first month living there, and also a work VISA. 

The annual income I've been offered is 35,000 euros, gross. So I would get around 2,250 euros per month after taxes. 

I know this is not a digital nomad work but I'm really interested in relocation and work VISA as this would allow me to search for better opportunities in the future. However, I would really like to know from someone who is currently based over there what do you think about this salary. In theory and looking in Glassdoor, the salary is on the average rank and it would be more than enough to cover all my expenses and save around 30%-40% each month if I don't have any extra spendings like travelling or such, but I'm a little bit blind on that and I don't want to accept an offer just because of the hype of going there and then regretting the pay is not that good.

Story is I was in a country that got super locked down when COVID first hit so after 3 months of ""waiting it out"" I returned to the US.  I've since bought a house in a touristy city as a ""home base"" with the intention to fix it up and rent it out AirBnB style.  It gave me a project and I was hoping once I was finished things would be back to normal, but hey this is where we are.

As I try and get back to travel I find myself disheartened as I read about destinations and wondering if I should even bother going abroad yet since it seems like restrictions and every day life is still pretty locked down.

So I'm hoping to hear from folks still on the ground about what their thoughts are for places where I could:

- Enter without long quarantines
- Has co-working locations open
- Can go out for dinner and drinks etc 
- Every day life has some semblance of normalcy

I'm in my late 30s and not the type to stay in hostels so generally I meet people through co-working spots and other professional venues.  Maybe I'm in my own head but everytime I look at destinations then read the guidelines I think well maybe I should just keep waiting?"
r67lj4,525cavyu,Tips on How to Be Mugged Effectively?,"I'm planning to go to some places where people reportedly get mugged in broad daylight, especially gringos, which I conspicuously am.

I wonder if anyone has any advice on how to be mugged effectively.  That is to say, with minimal cost, harm, violence, and trauma.

I usually carry around as little as possible, just in case stuff gets stolen.  Would a mugger be pissed at me if he's getting $10 and a credit card?

Do muggers take cell phones?  I'd mind that a lot more than cash or credit cards, since most of the time I wouldn't know how to get back to my place without a cell phone.

Losing money is just fine with me, and I'm sympathetic to people who believe they have as much right to my money as I do, which doesn't seem entirely wrong.  If the exchange is polite and all on the up and up, I wouldn't even mind.  I'd be happy to give them hundreds of dollars to keep my cell phone, but I imagine this would be difficult to negotiate on the spot, given that, if I have the money, they're getting it anyway.

Are there ways I can make my future mugging interactions more pleasant for everyone involved?

r7dqj3,,About Turkey...,"Why are Turkish people so sad and depressed???

&#x200B;

I’m a Westerner from the West, who’s been in Turkey for over 1 month—I’ve noticed most Turkish people seem sad and depressed. Most of them are glued to their phones, don’t smile, laugh, don’t say “Merhaba” when I say it (Means Hello) and even look at me weird or give me dirty looks. Whenever I laugh, dance, have energy or do anything other than sulking (like them) it’s very weird and awkward. Most of them are smoking and say it’s because of the economy and they are poor: But is the economy, tanking lira and being poor really making them so sad? 

Sure, I’m just an outsider, but I’ve been to plenty of other countries and this is absolutely the worst vibe I’ve ever gotten. It’s like being in a Nightmare. And I’ve dealt with a ton of Turkish women and it’s all gone very badly. They’ve been rude, not interested, didn’t want to meet again for no reason and it seems the only better chances are with foreigners like from Poland, Morocco or Tunisia etc. 

It’s a real mystery. 

I kinda hate Turkey, it’s cheap, beautiful, great food and there are a lot of friendly good hearted Turkish, it’s just this negative vibe and the women that really gets me down. I sorta don’t even want to talk or look at Turkish women because of the many, many bad experiences. And some will say it’s just not their culture to say Hi/Merhaba to a stranger, but to me that’s just being human. Where else will a foreigner/traveler meet people? 

I’m joining an English club, but should it be so hard to just meet someone?

And my Tinder in Turkey is horrible. Almost no matches, but in other places like Uganda, Philippines and Thailand etc. it’s crazy, even Dubai was explosive, so It’s definitely not me.

If you’ve ever been to Turkey for a while, know someone or live here—Please let me know if you agree with me, think I’m totally wrong or can shed some light on this “Sad situation”.

r7gvqi,d4oz2tk6,VPN Routers,"So I have been reading about VPN routers, as I work remote and I am thinking about doing some work from western Europe this spring (I’m a US/EU member state dual national). Ideally I’d maybe continue my current job for a while and then quit if I find something based in Europe while I’m there. I have a few coworkers who have worked short term (a few weeks) from India to visit family. So I don’t think we have an absolute  policy against abroad work, but I don’t think it’s something they encourage. 

I am considering asking my boss if he’d be ok with me doing some “short term” work out of the country but I’m new so I’m going to wait a bit. 

Anyway, on the subject of routers. I’ve read that VPN routers may use IPs known to be associated with VPNs. I’m not sure how on top of things our IT team is. We do have a company VPN that I don’t really need to use and they gave me a Meraki device to use for those rare scenarios. To gauge their suspicion, I was thinking of asking IT if they allowed the use of VPN routers in general, since it’s plausible for someone to use one in their home. 

Does that sound like an ok strategy? I’m aware that this comes with risks including termination. But this is something I’ve wanted to do for a while and aside from training my cat to tolerate his carrier, this is one of my main concerns."
r7j9oz,2oow22cn,How do you all make friends when you know only limited amounts of the language?,"I'm currently in Europe and struggling to find ways to meet people who I can connect with. I'm here with my wife while she's studying and each night while she's studying away, I'm making dinner for both of us and trying to go out. I've found music venues and while it's a place where I enjoy the atmosphere, it's too loud to really meet anybody with my limited local language skills. I'm learning the language and feel confident and in a more quiet environment, I can talk to people when they understand that I'm still relatively new to the language.

r7nzz4,4kqkoeb5,"For the digital nomads that write-off most of their travel expenses, how do you do it? (US citizens)","For three years now I've been a part time nomad while freelancing. Come 2022 I plan on being a full-time international nomad and am hoping to set things up differently to minimize expenses in general but especially on taxes.

I'm in the process of registering my business as an S-Corp to avoid self-employment taxes and plan on looking into the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (by being out of the country for 330 days) to avoid income taxes. But my question is, has anyone successfully been able to write off almost all travel expenses as business expenses?

My business is a global company. I work with a diversity of international organizations and hire contractors globally as well. Many of my clients are US based but the projects we do typically relate to a foreign audience (NGOs). I have the privilege of being able to plan my travel plans around the work I do by using my travels as an opportunity to 1) live in the country that the project serves during the duration of the project for field research and collaboration, 2) do probono work with local orgs, 3) networking and recruitment, 4) attend conferences or take courses for professional development, and 5) create content (think short docs and blog posts) related to the countries I visit under my business name. I feel like taking trips with at least one of these intentions means I can deduct: flights, accommodation, some dining, partial coworking spaces, partial hotspot internet, etc.

I may be totally wrong (it's quite confusing where the line is drawn) so what has been your experience with writing off travel expenses?"
r7wg1f,55bski0b,Safety Wing Evacuation,"Just thought I'd post my experience with SW. I've been in Cape Town since mid September (awesome place btw). As I'm sure everyone has heard the new variant was identified here and travel bans swiftly came in to place last week. I avoided the pandemonium of rushing to the airport to get out (I knew flights would be cancelled or cost thousands of dollars). I was content to stay put and lockdown if need be, but my visa here was quickly expiring. My next trip to the EU fell through due to the travel ban. So, I was kind of stuck. Flights were $4K+ to get out of there. I figured I'd email Safety Wing and see if they could help. Sure enough they came through found me a flight later in the week and covered the costs all the way back to the states. Incredible customer service, quick replies, I felt assured that they would get me out of here. I fly out today taking lots of tests, all the precautions, and getting ready to quarantine when I get back to the states. Not to mention I've been masked up my whole time here and spent most of my times outdoors. 

For future reference, for anyone stuck in this situation: If you're from the US, there's travel alert levels. 1 - 4 (4 being basically not advised to travel at all). If you enter the country and it's a level 2 (which I did) and while you're staying there, it goes up to a level 4 they will try and find you a flight out and cover the costs (depending on your plan)."
r82dsl,f4c68tpl,Argentina pitches its weak currency to attract digital nomads,"Does anyone have any experience with staying/working in Argentina and can offer some insights into the nomad lifestyle out there?

Excerpt from article ------ 

A city campaign to lure people that get paid in dollars, pounds and other currencies for extended stays touts that Argentina has “the most competitive exchange rate in the region” and “we are a very affordable city!” It’s part of a marketing message that includes a potential 12-month visa for remote workers, along with the benefits of Buenos Aires: Warm weather, bucolic boulevards, good food and relative safety compared with other cities in Latin America. 

Based on today’s unofficial exchange rates, US$1 will get you more than 200 pesos, up from 20 pesos just three years ago, a result of recession, 50 percent inflation and a cobweb of failed efforts to stabilize the Argentine currency. That means a ribeye steak at Don Julio, [ranked ](https://www.theworlds50best.com/list/1-50)the 13th best restaurant in the world, only costs 3,950 pesos, or about US$18 at the unofficial rate.

Do you recommend ""Digital Nomad"" insurance or Global Health Insurance?","I am about to start living a Vanlife lifestyle outside of my country of residence and cannot decide what kind of insurance is best for my travels, so I am looking for whatever advice people can give, or whatever experiences they could share to inform me. I'm really lost as to the details of the Global Health Insurance in particular. 

I have researched World Nomads, Safetywing and numerous global health insurance companies. I am both an EU and US citizen, if that's relevant. Here are the Pros and cons for the Nomad insurance, followed by questions for the health insurance.  Even giving answering one aspect wpuld be much appreciated:

* **Digital Nomad insurance is cheaper, but is possibly less useful**.  
(World Nomads is cheaper for me in the long term,  as I'm primarily travelling in the EU for the next few years. I may take trips to the US to see family for 1 or 2 months occasionally).
* **Cons:**
   * A lot of the benefits relate to air travel, which I won't often be using.
   * The device coverage is useful, but I could cover anything really important with another policy. (Such as camper van insurance).
   * No coverage for general health needs.
   * Really only useful for emergencies.
* **Pros:**
   * It does cover medical emergencies, which is my main concern.
   * Covers additional non-health emergencies and travel-related circumstances. 
   * Cheaper than Health Insurance.
   * Flexible.

&#x200B;

* **Health insurance is more comprehensive, but it's expensive and probably more than I need**.
   * **Can anyone recommend specific companies?** There are really so many. I've mainly been looking at IMG. I've heard a lot of people talk about Geoblue but they seem more expensive?
   * I'm 30 and healthy, have no conditions, etc. I haven't had a reason to go to the doctor in a literal decade (I do go for general visits and I know I'm not getting younger). **Is it still worth it to spend the money?**
   * I'm finding it hard to figure out if I'm covered for general visits in different companies' policies. **Does anyone know about general visits?**
   * It doesn't cover anything travel-related, which could put me in trouble occasionally. **Has anyone had any issues with lacking travel insurance?**

I've done a lot of research but still feel unsure so I really appreciate any and all info people can bring forward. Thank you!"

I am 23 years old and currently working for a nonprofit in NYC. I have dreams of becoming a digital nomad (ideally in 2-4 years time) and am wondering if anyone on this sub works in the nonprofit industry, or used to. 

I have been employed full time for just over a year now and work in development. The nonprofit industry is alright for me; I love doing meaningful work and helping people, but that's really the only draw for me right now. I am realizing that I don't love my day-to-day tasks as much and also would love to make more money.

Does anyone have experience transitioning from the nonprofit industry into a digital nomad career? I am starting to think about making a change and would like to ideally pick an industry that is compatible with my current experience and also could lead to a digital nomad lifestyle in the future.

Any and all advice and input would be much appreciated!

I excel at my position but still have huge chunks of time during the day where I can fill it with other work. So I’ve picked up a couple of freelance jobs on the side with American companies. 

I get paid in my US bank account and am paying taxes to the US on the freelance earnings, as my expat tax advantage applies to my income earned only here, but it recently occurred to me that simply working here for another company, even though it’s an American one might be a problem. 

The issue is that when I file my taxes every year I have to submit my US return as well which shows my freelance income there. It’s probably a fairly unique issue as I have both residency and a work visa but I think it's limited to my EU employer. Am I overthinking this or Is it something that I need to get sorted out?

r9q4id,,DN or settle down?,"I've asked this in a few other spots, but have been considering the DN life for a while now. I have the sort of job that allows endless travel, a home base to go back to in a pinch, amongst many other things that make this quite realistic for me.

Of course, I naturally find an amazing partner in the process (back home). We really hit it off, no real issues getting along, she's got a good job, handles my flaws very well, and has shown she truly cares about helping me become a better person (i.e. supportive of me quitting drinking).

I'm 37, and have been dating for about 20 years now. This is the first time I've dated someone that all my friends (so far) and my parents 110% approve of. Even my stepdad, who never has much to say about me dating, pulled me aside and told me I've got a keeper.

So we've discussed moving to somewhere warmer and cheaper, which is something I had in mind already. But for the life of me, I am struggling to make the choice. Travel or her? Obviously there are compromises...she supports me traveling extensively if it's what I really want to do. She has kids here and thus can't leave for months with me.

I feel if I leave to travel, I'm going to sorely regret losing her. If I stay and don't travel, I'll always have that urge to go. Even worse, if things don't work out with her, I'm surely going to be very beat up by it.

Has anyone else ever been through this?

People look down on us and price us out of our own land. People treat the oldest colony in the world as a place of leisure, not a place of struggle and suffering. If you have any solidarity with our people, you will not come. I know it can be confusing when it's talked about so positively all the time, but what people don't understand is that the goal is to have a Puerto Rico without Puerto Ricans, to depopulate the island of us and basically make it a huge, expensive resort for rich Americans. To stop that, please go somewhere else.

ra8gxe,6c0y3tb5,Digital nomad-ing in Japan? Looking for advice!,"I'm seriously considering and looking into Japan as my first digital nomad location (if they open their borders again, ugh). At the moment, I'm planning to go for the cherry blossom blooming season, over the span of two to three weeks in early spring. It looks like flights themselves are pretty much what I'd expect, and can totally afford. What I'm trying to figure out is what a reasonable budget will be once I'm there. From what I understand, Yotel in Tokyo can be very affordable and eating doesn't have to be all that expensive either. 

I'm looking to live comfortably enough, have enough fun, without going on an all-in splurge vacation or conversely, just scraping by to occupy some space in Japan for a few weeks. I'll need some space and internet connection to do my work during the week and would definitely prefer to have a private room in a well-linked area so that I can get the most out of my trip. I don't really know anyone over there so I want to find the right places, forums online or actual places in Japan where I can meet other foreigners, travelers, and digital nomads who are english speakers.

I'd be flying in an out of Tokyo so I'll probably spend most of my time there, but I'd be interested in visiting Kyoto and other regions, even for a weekend or just a few days.

Definitely not asking for anyone here to plan my trip but I'd love to hear from those who have done their digital nomad-ing from Japan, what it was like, tips from experience, what you'd do differently a second time, what resources you found helpful, etc.!"

rag1x1,bgcau9yx,Portugal D7 Visa - US Veteran Disability Income,"Hi all, curious to know if there are any US veterans who were approved for a Portugal D7 visa using their disability compensation as a sole passive income source. Was there any trouble proving that this was a stable income source? Was there some combination of other income/savings in addition to your rating amount that worked towards approval? Is there anyone who has been rejected on those grounds not being adequate (in spite of the rating meeting the recommended minimums)?

As a side-note: I'm at 90%, with IU, so currently paid at 100%. This is my sole income until otherwise. I'm daily doing work towards improving health while attempting to start my own remote business (I compose music), so being somewhere calmer and a bit more stable (and where healthcare/therapies could be better accessed) would seem to go a long way towards becoming more effective all around.

I would really appreciate any advice you can give me. So far these are the careers I am looking at: **UI/UX Designer, Motion Graphics Designer, Data Analytics.**

I have a Bachelors in Fine Arts, my background is in graphic design and illustrations for ad agencies. And I have worked alot in Adobe XD recently, prototyping landing pages for the last two companies I worked for. So UI/UX design seems to be the sensible direction for me. I'm confident in UI design, I feel I'm pretty good at it... I just don't know how to code (I will have to learn).

Also, I've been looking at shifting into motion design. I've gotten comfortable in After Effects. Seems to pay better than just a regular print/digital designer. But I'm not sure if the salary and available jobs will be better than UI/UX design.

Data analytics I just hear is the new thing that is growing in demand. But sounds kinda boring to me, being a designer at heart.

Wow, writing out my decision really lends perspective. But I still want to know everyone's thoughts. If any of you have experience in any of these fields, I would really appreciate the insight. I've been trying to become a digital nomad for the past 4 years.

I've been doing tax consulting for location independent entrepreneurs (digital nomads) for 20+ years and this is typically the biggest question people ask.

The  reality is that there is no blanket solution.  Each person's situation is different.

A German with an ecommerce business living in Bali has a completely different situation than an American with a SaaS business living in Mexico.  

Different situations often mean different solutions.

rb6ccl,5ow33,"""Travel Routers"" with VPN support","Hi all,

As the title suggests, I'm looking for a ""travel router"" or wifi repeater with the ability to use OpenWRT or a VPN built in. When researching, stumbled upon a post from this sub (which I can't find) and also a [post in onebag](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/klxxmm/best_mini_travel_router/) about the Mango GL.inet router, but on actually buying and using the device it doesn't seem to support some EU wifi channels (>11), and I'm looking for something with similar features that do, predominantly because I don't know exactly what type of WiFi network I'll end up connecting to and would like to ensure the maximum compatibility.

I primarily want a device like this because in a couple of spots I'll be staying in old repurposed hotels which still have a shared WiFi, so I'd like to have a bit more control of the network and get around any device limits (because the router will function as 1 device instead of 3). The VPN support is mostly so I can share my VPN across all the devices I'll be connecting instead of needing a software VPN on each, but might come in useful for work.

Ideally, I'd like to keep the budget under £200, but if the device is bombproof and maybe also accepts a SIM for 5G, I could be flexible.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions"

rbk3ji,3qqot61n,Question to Candian Digital Nomads: How do you protect yourself from CRA? What are some horror stories or mistakes relating to CRA and non-residency that I need to be aware of?,"I am Canadian citizen. I am not a resident of another country at this moment. I am not a citizen of another country.  Ever since I become a non-resident, CRA keeps finding ways to get money out of me. I was given bad information from a couple of CRA representatives and one accountant.

1. A couple of CRA reps and accountant said I did not have to file 2020 tax return based on my situation but I talked to one CRA rep ( August 2021) and he told me I have to file my 2020 tax return since one of my investments here in Canada had capital gains. So I missed the deadline to file taxes for 2020. I asked a lot of reps at CRA and told them my situation and they all told me not to file 2020 tax return and now I am being punished by their bad advice.
2. One CRA rep told me that she made me a Canadian resident for a short period of time from April 2021 to Sept 2021 because of COVID-19 and the global lockdown. Based on that info, I put money into my TFSA savings account during that short period of time. Then I just find out last week that I am being charged for putting money into the TFSA account even though I was told verbally in that short period that I was made a Canadian resident. This f\*ckin CRA rep did not tell me that I had to file NR74. THis lady gave me wrong info. I have no way to prove she said it. So now I have to pay for this fine.

CRA reps give you bad advice as a result you sometimes get f\*cked by their bad advice.

How do you protect yourself from CRA? How do you deal with them when they want to charge you for things you do not seem it is reasonable? What are some horror stories or mistakes relating to CRA and non-residency that I need to be aware of?  Thanks!"

rbnxq3,dcjszxg2,What’s a work policy that made you love your job more?,"Hey all! Our CEO (we work in a digital marketing startup) is very thirsty to try unorthodox ideas, and keeps on mentioning that office work “is becoming obsolete” because traditional workplace policies tend to hold everyone back or drag everyone down. 

So now we’ve been exploring a [distributed workforce](https://www.oysterhr.com/library/remote-vs-distributed?&/?r=1) (she gave us this to read lol) for the past few months, and I’m loving the idea. 

Compared to a remote setup, our take on work is to get an assigned workload to accomplish within a certain point. We keep our meetings at 30-45mins, and that’s about the only time we’re all required to attend anything. Of course we make sure we’re available to chat in case of emergencies, but this definitely gives us a lot of free room to rest, explore our hobbies, and appreciate life at work in general. 

There’s a few things I miss of course, like seeing coworkers regularly (even in Zoom back when the pandemic started), and there are some hiccups in workflow every now and then. But I’m willing to see where this leads us. 

Do you have something like this in your job? Are there policies that made you love your work/company more? I’m interested to know! Thanks!"
rbqdep,3708v,has anyone here legally stayed in the Schengen zone for more than 90 days by using bilateral agreements?,"Apparently certain countries have [bilateral agreements](https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/how-to-legally-stay-in-europe-for-more-than-90-days/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20France,French%20national%20archives.) (search page for 'bilateral agreements') that will allow certain foreign nationals to stay longer than 90 days in the Schengen zone, provided these foreigners remain in the country in question. For example, US citizens can technically stay in France for 90 days regardless of how long they've been in the Schengen zone (allowing you to stay elsewhere for 89 days, then in France for 90). Poland and Denmark also have such bilateral agreements with the US.

However at least in the case of France, actually making use of the law (which precedes the Schengen agreement but remains on the books) seems a bit dicey because the absence of border controls within Schengen means there's no official way to know how long someone's been in France. Thus applying it remains up to the discretion of the border police.

I'm wondering if anyone's had experience using these agreements."
rbqhr6,8ha5kf52,Crazy Brainfart: Better connected community for starting/established nomads," 

Hey guys,

I am currently planning the start of my nomad life. I am currently still employed at a company in the Netherlands, that recently introduced a remote working policy with the EU. I am super happy about this decision. Its like a dream comes true!

However, in the preparation of packing my stuff and moving, I did have a feeling that the community is rather scattered: There are multiple forums, here on reddit, and multiple on fb - most of them are really generic, but as soon as I start to dig deeper into cities or regions, I do have to look up a specific group for this. Being a software engineer, I really always have the tendency to look for improvements and to help the community to make all our lives a bit easier.

The idea that I had: How would it be if all nomads would have one app through which they can log their current location and plan their trips to different locations and through it reach out to people that are already there or can help planning the trip.

I wonder if the community would be interested in and can see value in this or not! Please let me know your honest thoughts! Poke as many holes as you like!

PS: This is really meant to support the community and develop it further. Its not meant to replace any of the existing groups!"

rbwa3c,wwwf5,Questions Regarding the Recent Mexico FMM Crackdowns,"Hey folks,

My partner and I are planning a 3 month trip to Mexico next year and we were planning to enter via the FMM. Based on what we were originally reading, they almost always auto-approved everyone for the time they requested (up to 180 days) and were fairly lax, so we weren't worrying too much while planning.

Unfortunately, it seems like recently INM is seriously cracking down on people doing this and often only granting 15 or 30 days in the country, especially for folks who are repeatedly re-entering the country or younger people staying for an extended period of time (we are both in our mid 20's).

My partner and I have only been to Mexico once and that was nearly a decade ago. We are planning to stay in Puerto Escondido for a month and Playa del Carmen for 2 months. 

I've read that a copy of our itinerary with proof of return flight in 90 days, AirBnB stays, stuff we're planning to do there as well as a picture of our bank accounts to prove we're solvent enough to stay here is usually enough if they question you, but I'm a bit worried now.

I really don't want to have our entire trip completely snuffed because of this, seems like the up-to 180 rule of thumb for staying in Mexico used in the past is out the window for a lot of DMs.

Should we just bite the bullet and get a temporary residence visa to guarantee our stay? Has anyone here gone through that process for Mexico and if so, what was it like? My partner and I aren't married, and both U.S citizens, so not sure if that makes things easier or more difficult. 

Any insight into this is greatly appreciated!  


Thanks!"

I've been DNing for years, first as a freelancer, now I work remote in a company. I've been working for that company for less than a year, and I'm not very happy with the job for several reasons (being underpaid, cliquey team, repetitive work, no career progression). I've had a few headhunters reach out to me and I started interviewing for other jobs, and now I got a job offer that I do want to take.

The new company wants me to start February 1. My current company has no idea. My notice period is a month, but I can't help but feel bad about quitting after less than a year. I'm never suuuuper busy at my job and I only have one weekly call with the team, so right now I'm thinking to just not quit and continue at my old job for 1-3 months (while accepting the new role), take the extra money and feel less guilty about quitting so soon. I feel torn about this though. I would give the priority to the new job of course and risk getting fired from my old job. Still not sure if this is a good idea.

Has anyone here done this for a (short) while, working at two remote jobs at the same time? If so, how was your experience? If so and if not, any advice?

rex9zo,c4om1m2g,Another Mexico FMM interpretation,"Hey guys,   
I recently flew from Europe to Cancún, to travel the beautiful country of Mexico for a few months. When I got to the immigration agent I said that it was my first time and that I was here for tourism. Then she asked how long I wanted to stay and I said I had a return ticket for in 4 months. She didn't comment or ask to see it or any other booking confirmation. She just nodded her head, signed the FMM and said welcome to Mexico. So I assumed that I got lucky and got the full 180 days but now I'm second guessing myself. Especially because it's so hard to decipher what she wrote down. Do you guys think I got 15, 150 or 180 days? Thank you for your help!

i will be working part - time while down there and need semi stable wifi. my job is pretty low stress and i don't need to be on video call, just googlevoice, slack, and using our software which works internationally. with a vpn (thinking of purchasing nord, but open to suggestions if you have them), i should be good. 

we plan to fly in to cancun, do the tulum thing for a long weekend and spend the rest of our days in the region on either isla holbox or isla mujeres to be closeish to cancun for our flight to oaxaca, then puerto escondido, and flying back to spend the rest of the trip in cdmx with friends/family. cdmx is where i plan to fly out of.

is the wifi in these locations as terrible as this sub makes it out to be? i'm currently at my parent's house in bum-f\*\*k country town, usa for the holidays and we have literally one dinky power line connected to our home and wifi comes in and out (as do the lights sometimes haha) and i'm able to work just fine. i ran a speed test moments ago and it reported that the wifi here is ""strong"". is the wifi in these places similar? should we nix these locations for other locations that have better working wifi accommodations like playa del carmen or cancun proper? i'm not stoked on the idea of playa del carmen or cancun, but will stay there if that's better.

rezy24,,Advice for Canadian who wants out for a year. Looking for best city as a base in Europe for me and my cat...,"Need suggestions of cities etc. Will take care of visa and logistics myself. 

Hi folks,

I'm pretty new to all this but I'd like to get some advice.

About me
I'm a male in my 20s and work in software development. I'll be working two remote jobs and will be pulling in almost $160k USD. I'm going to apply in summer of 2022 for my Canadian citizenship but can leave the country while it's processing. My current citizenship is with a weak passport, if that matters for later.

What I want
I want to get out of Canada while my application is processing, approx from Jul-Aug 21 for a year. I can work both jobs remotely. Here's some of the things that are important.
- Some place which is rather cosmopolitan and welcomes foreigners.
- Has pleasant weather, doesn't need to be too hot. I like sunshine too.
- Where everything just works, and I don't have to hustle too much. Eg. Internet speed, water, getting bank stuff done. Etc. Estonia seems appealing in this regard but the dreary seeming winter's don't seem to appeal to me.
- I'll be travelling with my cat, and would like to live in a one bedroom apartment I think, I'd like to spend €750-1000 Euros). But this is not a hard budget.
- Plenty of opportunities to try out new clubs and activities as well as continue with old pens. Examples are CrossFit, dancing (eg. Tango, salsa etc.), yoga, boxing etc.
- low degree of social isolation. Eg somewhere I can easily make new friends from around the world.
- I'm single, so it would be good to date women too.
- I'd like to explore the rest of Europe too in this one year, so trains and cheap flights would be awesome too... 
- Ideally cost of living would be on the lower side... 

Have briefly considered Ljubljana, Lisbon, Taillin but would really appreciate your suggestions!

Thanks!"
rf58u2,90cv1nb7,Alternative to Google Fi? What do you guys use for phone service in multiple countries?,"I've been in Colombia for two months and my Fi just shut off. Luckily I have a secondary T-Mobile phone which I can use in several countries abroad, but the data is laughably slow.

I'm planning on getting a local SIM (like $12 for 30 gb) but as a nomad, I don't think getting a local SIM in every country is ideal, as my number would change every 3-6 months.

Or for example, I'm going to Mexico next week for a visa run and my Colombian SIM won't work there, so I figure I'd need a whole new SIM, which is kinda annoying. I like Google Fi for allowing you to keep one number that works pretty much anywhere.

How do you guys handle phone service?

I'm a Dutch national and, like an exemplary citizen,  I have registered myself at the Dutch embassy here. Just today, I got an e-mail from them that Malaysia has been open for tourism since November 24.

I've copy-pasted the translated e-mail below:

>Dear Dutch in Malaysia,  
>  
>As of November 24, fully vaccinated people are allowed to visit Malaysia, provided that you first stay in Langkawi for 7 days. On day 8 you are allowed to continue your journey within Malaysia. When planning your trip, keep the following conditions in mind:

1. Plan your trip through a licensed travel agency/travel agent (registered with MOTAC), located at [https://motac.gov.my/en/check/tobtab](https://motac.gov.my/en/check/tobtab)
2. You can only fly directly to Langkawi or via KLIA or Penang
3. Upon arrival you must meet a number of test obligations, see our Facebook page for more information.
4. You must stay in Langkawi for at least 7 days before you can continue your trip to other places in Malaysia. However, you must do a PCR test 2 days before you continue your trip, if you have a negative result you can leave on day 8. If you only want to visit Langkawi, you should stay there for at least 3 days.

>In addition, you should have the following documentation with you:  
>  
>\- Proof of insurance in the amount of at least USD 80,000 for Covid-19 and travel related costs;  
>  
>\- A fully completed “Health Declaration Form” from the Ministry of Health;

>\- Downloaded the mobile app “MySejahtera” and completed the registration in it;  
>  
>\- Proof of vaccination (28 days after the last vaccination);  
>  
>\- A negative PCR test taken no more than 48 hours before departure, no more than 72 hours before the flight to Langkawi.  
>  
>For a complete overview of the terms and conditions, please consult our Facebook page 'DutchEmbassyMalaysia'.

Like I said, I had no knowledge of this until today's email. I also haven't researched it any further since I am here on a different kind of visa! But I thought I'd post it here since it may be very useful for some people here looking to stay in MY for some time. It seems like the only requirements, apart from being vaccinated, are to stay in Langkawi for 7 days and book through a travel agency (from which there are 4813 listed on the mentioned website, should be possible to find one that's willing to accommodate to your needs/ leave you alone once you pay them off )

EDIT: It's 'secret' since I've been trying to follow the MY news regarding reopening/ covid measures intensively. I haven't heard from this at all even though I check daily. The government talks a lot about Langkawi being open, but not at all that you can continue traveling through all of Malaysia after 7 days in Langkawi. Hence 'secret'. But I could've just missed the news about it of course."
rfi5gl,f4c68tpl,Spain reduces tax for digital nomads,"Spain already has some great programs in place, such as their village gentrification, program, and it's a stunning destination, but it would be interesting to hear from anybody's personal experience of nomad and tax life in Spain up to this point. 

In short, it sounds like the new bill makes it easier to get a visa to be a remote worker or nomad in Spain in addition to streamlining the business set-up process and offering tax incentives. 

It looks like Nomads, and startups will be subject to a reduced non-resident tax for 5 years, which works out at 15%, down from 24%, or 19% if you're from an EU country. 

Excerpt below, original [article](https://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/2021/12/11/digital-nomad-visa-and-tax-breaks-how-spain-wants-to-attract-remote-workers/) and [tweet](https://twitter.com/_minecogob/status/1469666953807777795?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1469666953807777795%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theolivepress.es%2Fspain-news%2F2021%2F12%2F11%2Fdigital-nomad-visa-and-tax-breaks-how-spain-wants-to-attract-remote-workers%2F) info ----

The Spanish Government is to cut taxes for digital nomads as it aims to boost start-up culture in the country. Spain is hoping to lure more remote workers to emigrate.

The new measures announced by Spain will allow foreign digital workers to use a non-resident tax status with lower rates for five years.

Spain’s economy ministry tweeted that the new laws would “attract and retain international and national talent”."

rfoiqz,12v86w,"Anyone else confused by all of those ""Digital Nomad Visa"" shenanigans?","""Tax incentives"" and ""Streamlined the process of creating a startup"" and ""non-resident tax status"".

What?

How does any of this apply to digital nomads? I'm employed in my home country. Even if I was a freelancer, I'd probably be paying taxes in my home country. The only reason for me to change that would be:

1. Because it's cheaper paying taxes somewhere else than my home country (like Bulgaria, or, you know, Dubai? Malta? No idea)
2. Because I want to stay somewhere for more than 6 months, or 1 / 3 / however many that country allows on a tourist visa

In case of 1.: Why, even if I was a freelancer, wouldn't I then simply go to the most bestest country with the lowest taxes? That probably won't be any of those countries announcing their Shiny New Digital Nomad visas right now, so why should I care?

In case of 2. there's two parts:

2a: If we're talking about stays that are less than six months, wouldn't I then still be tax resident somewhere else, like my home country for example? Wouldn't I then be paying taxes twice?

2b: Except, I mean, if we're talking about stays that last more than six months I guess it's a bit different, but then we're really talking about expats, not nomads. But I guess it depends on how you define a ""digital nomad"", which is a can of worms I'd rather not open right now. But come on, if all of this hubbub only affects people who want to stay more than six months anyway I find it a bit misleading talking about ""Digital Nomad Visas"". Also wouldn't you then probably be a resident in your country of choice anyway? Why wouldn't you want that?

What about this ""easier to create a startup"" stuff? Are you going to create a new company every time you move to a new country? How is this relevant to any of us?

I'm so confused. What's all of this hype about? Who's those visas for? And why would us nomads be so excited about getting taxed? I already pay taxes, why would I want to pay the taxes of every country I visit? Aaaagh so many questions."

rft4fu,rmnzw,Long-time dreamer first-time digitalnomader (Costa Rica tips?),"Hey all, I've lurked this sub for awhile and had always wanted to try the digital nomad life and I just haven't. I've been able to work remotely the last 4 years and have been forced to work remotely for the last year and a half. Since my forced wfh lifestyle I've contemplated the digitalnomad life a lot and just been anxious about it. My therapist has convinced me to get over my fears and try it out. So here I am asking for some advice.

For those curious, what has kept me from doing this before has always been my fear to do things by myself and not having anyone to do this with. I just get anxiety when doing something for the first time cause I worry what will happen if I hate it. My therapist has convinced me it's better to try something and learn that you don't like it or are not good at it then to always wonder; wondering has been a big source of unhappiness for me lately so I'm thinking I'm going to take the plunge. Not sure when I will actually embark on this trial run due to covid so that is up in the air but it looks like travel is currently permitted to Costa Rica.

My primary reason for posting here is to ask for some advice about Costa Rica and if it's a good place for a first timer. My functional concerns are primarily: 1) Does the country have decent internet (I just need to be able to attend google meet meetings with my camera on)? 2) Are the people welcoming/friendly to foreigners (I lean introvert but warm up quickly to people that are friendly)? 3) Is there anything I should be aware of about Costa Rica specifically? 4) Are there any reasons to avoid Cotsa Rica as a first-timer?

Reasons for wanting to go to Costa Rica: 1) It's not the US or Canada 2) it's within 1-hour of my normal time-zone 3) I want to spend my free-time in nature

As for where is CR I was thinking Manuel Antonio because of it being right next to the national park and also being in the middle of some other areas I'd want to visit on weekends. Anyone have experience with that area?

For those wondering how I would handle working abroad I'll be fine. I currently work on a macbook with no second screen and my ""desk"" is a chair with a pizza board laying across the armrest, workspace not important haha. Also, I have worked for weeks at time at friends houses and things like that when visiting them. Also, also, I have visited around 23 countries from Kenya, to Latvia, to Cuba so I would say I am well traveled and that part does not concern me. Mostly just worried about internet and connecting with people.

Thanks for reading the long post and any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated. Anything I may be missing that I should consider would also be extremely helpful. Thanks!"

rg3wye,44wmo10q,Vaccine Hurdles as a Digital Nomad,"I'm an American Digital Nomad who left the States for the Netherlands in early September 2021.  I received both doses in Los Angeles.

Once I landed in the Netherlands, the country adopted a rule that you needed a QR code for entry to restaurants and other indoor activities. Since we are the behind in the times, I needed to register my US vaccination card with the government. To do this, I first needed to get a social security number, also known as a BSN number. The process took me three weeks. The NL gave me the country's QR code as well as an international QR code (Which has been excellent for me as a I bounced around to neighboring countries). Towards the end of my 90 day schengen visa, I requested to receive the booster in the NL since I was registered in the system. I was denied, however, because I was not born before 1935 (LOLOL).  At this point, I was past the 6 month mark.

I relocated to Cypus on December 1 (omicron had just surfaced). Although Cyprus (greek side) is in the EU, it is outside the schengen area. Here, they also require QR codes for everything... including access to grocery stores. After one week, Cyprus announced that starting December 18 the country was no longer accepting vaccinations older than 7 months. Perfect. I went to the walk-in clinic and was denied a booster because I am not a resident. I emailed the government about my predicament explaining that although I was a tourist, I planned on staying here the full 90 days...Nope. I also emailed the US Embassy. nope. The fact that I registered my vaccine in another EU country was a losing argument, as well as my health and the health and safety other Cypriots.

SOOOOOO, after a day of stressing, I  found out that the UK does not give a F about who they give the vaccine/booster too. (Hell ya Brexit). So I'm flying to London to receive the booster and then hoping I can register it with the Cyprus government or with the NL government (although I have no more entry days until March. ha) so I can update my international EU QR code.

This vaccination process has proven to be the biggest hurdle that I've faced thus far in my digital nomad pandemic life. 

\*\*Keep on eye out for these booster regulations... they come out of nowhere.

\*\*as a side note, I also applied and received the digital nomad visa from Estonia. The process was quick and easy. The D visa for Estonia makes me eligible for the vaccine as well."

It's a mini-Nuevo Vallarta/Cabo, much less crowded and less spring breakers. Lovely weather, hot sun, big waves and some calmer spots (Playa Tranquila, Playa la Ropa). Definitely recommend if you're in Mexico and want to do a month on a not so crowded beach.

Flying there is preferable, although the cuota/toll highway from Morelia is very safe as well. Regular recommendations apply: don't drive at night and don't venture off the main highways, there are some dangerous spots nearby. Tourist areas are very safe.

rglh3u,799uxd04,Portuguese NHR and Estonian company,"I'm an it professional trying to decrease my taxes, currently at Spanish tax range of 47%.

I hired a Portuguese lawyer and want to share with you folks the summary of the setup.

Basically for 2 reasons;
Help ppl looking for the same setup;
Be sure that this real, because looks too good to be true. I paid a lawyer but want to know if there is someone here with a similar setup.

For those who don't know NHR is a tax incentive in Portugal that reduces to 20% tax of any Portuguese income and 0% for foreign incomes during 10 years. Also in Portugal, you will pay 0% in cryptocurrency gains (if isn't your main activity).

And Estonian companies have 0% in salary if you don't live there, 0% if the money stays in your company and flat 20% in dividends.

Easiest Setup - no Estonian company: 
Get the NHR status and open a sole trader company (recibo verde). Pay a flat 20% tax, good weather, cheap cost of living, good airport, done.

Alternative setup - Live in Portugal with Estonian company:
Why Estônia? Because isn't on Portuguese tax heaven list like Montenegro and others that I've checked. Also really good online tax system.

Portuguese CFC rules only applies if:
* Your company is in the tax heaven list, Estonia isn't.
* If the tax is less than 50% of the Portuguese tax, will not apply if you are NHR, because is the same 20%.
But here is the trick.. contract yourself has an employer for half of the salary you want to have. And withdrawal the other half via dividends. And you will decrease to 10% keeping in the limit of the Portuguese CFC.

Example: 5k monthly.
Pay a salary from your Estonian company at € 2500,00. In this case 0% in Estonia because you don't live there and 0% in Portugal because is a foreign income (NHR).
The other half you get via dividends, and pay 20% of € 2500 = 500€ tax.

You will get 5k and pay 10% (500€).

The lawyer told me that the first setup is the easier way and no problem at all. The second it's ok in a bit grey area but under the law.

I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. Just sharing the idea. 

Hopping to see if there's anyone here using this setup without any issues."
rglync,iit5r,Where to move to ease long-distance relationship,"Hi everyone!

I'm currently in the UK (Italian citizen) and I have a relationship with a Russian man. I'd like to move somewhere closer to him for a long period (probably establish tax residency too).

He's currently a student so he can't travel all the time. We're meeting in winter / summer but I'd like to move somewhere where we could meet in the weekends.

While talking about it, Tallinn and Helsinki were two obvious choices.

However,

\- Tallinn has an incredibly high social tax (33%) on top of the income tax (20-25%) if I pay myself a salary from my company - and little to no real benefit in the social infrastructure itself. It would take a toll on me as I'm currently paying 30% TOTAL tax burden in the UK (21% avg income tax, 9% social tax)

\- Helsinki is an amazing place and a childhood dream, but I can't afford it right now. The total tax burden would be around 60%, even higher than Tallinn, and I'm not sure I can afford to live a decent life in one of the most expensive cities in the World with 40% of my income.

Anything I'm missing?

Anyone currently living in Tallinn that's open to chatting?

Thanks!

So far, my shortlist includes (no order):

Kiev, Ukraine

Cluj, Romania

Belgrade, Serbia

&#x200B;

However, I'm finding more information about tourists visiting these places rather than people staying for multiple months. I figure this would be the best sub to source unbiased opinions.

Cheap (less than $800 rent for 1bd)

A young city with vibrant nightlife (maybe near a large university)

Easy/Cheap Access to Western Europe by train or plane

Solid and safe intercity public transport

Minimal racism (I'm okay with stares, but no violence or maltreatment)

Internet is also important, but I don't think I'll have too much of an issue with that anywhere in Europe. Any suggestions?"
rgzjnv,4fjcizo4,Is the golden age of digital nomading coming to an end? It depends on your point of view...,"When we left the US at the end of 2017 to become digital nomads, we immediately fell in love with the lifestyle. In fact, during our first month on the road, my husband and I looked at each other and said, ""This is the best decision we ever made. We're never going back""

This month we start our fifth year as nomads and we still love it, and have no intentions of stopping any time soon. 

That being said, looking back at those first two years before Covid, it sure feels like it was a golden age for nomading. The concept of nomading wasn't anything new and was already getting press (heck, we were interviewed by CBS Sunday Morning, Money, and the NY Times Magazine that first year) but it still felt like the nomad community was pretty small and once you knew a few other nomads, you knew them all. 

And places like Bansko, Bulgaria, were still relatively unknown, and back then almost no one was talking about Tbilisi, Georgia. 

Fast forward to now, and thanks to Covid and so many people discovering remote working, it feels like that ""Golden Age"" of nomading is at least changing, if not over. Which is inevitable, of course. Nomading in 2017 wasn't what it was 2007, which wasn't what it was in 1997. That's just life. 

What feels different now is the rising cost of accommodations, especially of Airbnb, the potential influx of so many new nomads all at once, and overcrowded ""hotspots"" like Bali, Thailand, and Mexico starting to push back by cracking down on visa runs, overstays, etc. 

So, yeah, the ""Golden Age"" as it was for us is probably over. But that doesn't mean what comes next is going to be awful. We figure digital nomads are a resourceful bunch and will keep discovering new places eager to have nomads become part of their tourist mix. 

We're certainly not stopping any time soon. Anyway, here is our entire article on the topic, including interviews with a number of other nomads.

What career leaves you the most unbothered during a workday?","I started down the Python rabbit hole last week because I figure programming could lead to a great remote job. However, I'm coming to find that the doors this language and adjacent languages like SQL open up may not give me the peace and quiet I'm looking for.

I'm not opposed to hard work, and I think I could get by on a modest salary. What I am opposed to is unreasonable oversight, innumerable meetings, constant inbound phone calls or any other work-related interruptions that are not actually work. I just want to be able to do my work within a deadline, submit it and have it be viewed as at least acceptable by my far-off boss and coworkers.

Am I barking uo the right tree? Is Python, or programming in general, going to lead to jobs that allow me to focus on doing the job itself, or should I be considering some other line of work? I'd love some feedback from newbiea and seasoned vets alike.

(My background is as a teacher, and these days I work retail and customer service, essentially. If these are transferrable skills to other remote jobs NOW that align with my ideals, by all means tell me. I'd rather not have to reinvent myself if it isn't actually necessary.)"

rhbsci,meft2,Have you switched to a heavier computer and regretted it?,"Been nomading forever so I have a 13"" ultrabook. 

Thinking about upgrading the computer to have an anti-glare screen so I can work outside in the shade, but also needing a much more powerful machine. The good video editing stats seem to only really come in 15"" laptops. I'm looking at the Dell XPS line. 

The 13"" start at 1.2 kg (2.9 lbs), and the 15"" at  1.83  (4lbs)!

I'm basically always at my weight limit for my carry on and my checked bag, despite having lots of ultralight stuff.

I'm doing really simple editing but my software wasn't keeping up today with a small zoom file (and actually messed up my export) and I never want to do that again.

So, think I'll regret lugging around a 15"" laptop? I usually only use it at ""home"" (hotel, hostel, and their restaurant) but work is getting more intense and important so it's possible I'll bring it along to my fav cafe or a work spot. 

Do 15"" laptops fit on your actual lap or do they teeter back and forth as you type?

The other option is just to hire someone to do all of my video editing. I'm not sure how easy it is to explain to someone else which one of my takes was the good one, and I still have to upload the video so they can edit it.

Second, Ho Chi Minh City — I’ve never been in Vietnam so I don’t have an opinion. From what I’ve heard it seems to be cheaper than Chiang Mai and the quality of life is on par. If anyone lives or lived in Ho Chi Minh city can help me out with some information about the city, it’d be great. 

I also have Kuala Lumpur as an alternative. I’ve been there in 2018 and I had a great time. It’s a big city though so its more akin to Bangkok. To be honest, I’d rather not live in a big city. I want a more laid back, big town vibe.

I spent a week in the Turks and Caicos working remotely a few months ago to see what it would be like, and it was kind of just depressing because I was stuck in my AirBNB working from 9-5. By the time I stopped working, it was dark out. Sunset was around 7pm, so I got an hour of beach time per day and that was about the only benefit I could perceive.

I want to incorporate to provide a Stripe wrapper for accepting payments and also legal separation.

Some things that I look for:

* Can be run fully online
* Stripe-Bank Account opening (and online)
* Minimal tax (I will be paying myself a 100% salary)
* Least paperwork and legal filings as possible
* Ability to pay sub 0% in company tax (And full taxation through personal

I am currently in Dubai, and this place seems perfect for incorporation. Unfortunately, the setup fees are very high $10,000, which is not in my budget.

So I narrowed it down to:

1. Estonia
2. Wyoming

## Cons

## Estonia

* Requires monthly filings/returns
* Running costs are \~$1000 per year
* Salaries / director pay is counted as distribution of income, subjecting you to a 20% corporation tax (+14% director tax / dividends tax)
* As of 2021, they have a crackdown on e-businesses

## Wyoming

* Looks like you need to be physically be present in the US. It's not efficient/easy to run online.
* US taxation system is over-complicated. As a non-US citizen, I am looking at 2-4 forms filed per year.

## Pros

## Estonia

* Can be run online

## Wyoming

* Easy set up. More established. Supports the US economy.

Here is a John. 

\- he is Green Card holder;

\- he works remotely for the US\\California company.

\- now he lives in California, has California Real ID;

\- he pays taxes, has a SSN;

 Just because he is from Europe and work remotely, it doesn't makes sense to live in the US, but he need to do that to keep the green card and ability to work for the US company.

Is there any option for the Green Card holders to keep a permanent residence in the US but travel and live outside the US more then 180 days without hassle? John is okay to pay taxes or visit the US for a few month per year, but need more freedom about living outside the US.

For instance, buy a condo/house?"

I don't do coworking spaces etc. Have no need. Only other expenses would be nightlife and day trips / exploring


However it also looks like one of those cities you can zip through in a week.

The biggest thing I've seen to do there is the mosque and hot air balloons

For healthcare.... I saw you can sign up private for pretty cheap to and have access to some really good healthcare - in comparison to most cheaper locations.

Likewise, visa costs also seem pretty cheap although I am slightly confused about longer term options."

rkiyzd,cdxwn0i3,Starting to work at 4am because different timezones?,"Hi,

I need advice on what to do. I work in SEO and have been a digital nomad for a few years. I currently work in a job that I'm not super happy with, so I started interviewing for other companies (all remote jobs) and now I got an offer.

The thing is: It's fully remote, but not very flexible with hours. I'm European and it's a European company, so that means European hours (I have to be online between 10am and 4pm CET). I am going to be be in Mexico (EST time) for a couple of months, so 6h behind. I told them that in advance and I booked it a while ago, so there is no way I'm gonna cancel it. But if I wanna take that job that means that I'll need to get up at 4am every morning to work. As an SEO person I don't have a lot of calls (besides a few with the team), so I'm surprised they didn't give me more flexibility, but it is what it is.

I'm not really sure what to do now. I'm not a morning person, but I'd be more than happy getting up a bit earlier. But 4am? That's still night time. I'm probably gonna be in Europe again around June/July next year, but that still means a couple of months getting up at ungodly hours. I am considering it though, since I am interested in the job and it would be a challenge I guess. Also, maybe they will be a bit more flexible a few months in after they get to know me, who knows. I could also stay at my current job, where they care less about what time I work, so I could keep my normal schedule. But that would mean staying in a job that I'm not super happy about (I'm being underpaid and I'm bored with the job in general).

Would love to hear advice, maybe also from those who have gotten up really early for a job for a while.

Thank you!"

rl137r,rgonfuk,Thoughts on Sri Lanka as a winter destination?,"Sri Lanka, or rather the south of it, seems like a tempting destination for January and August:
- only vaccination required to get in, no test, no quarantine, not even possibility of quarantine if x/y/z happens
- cheap, decent English, safe
- weather in the non-monsoon bits seems ideal if a bit too hot (22 to 30 degrees celsius with high~ish humidity and occasional clouds and rain)

My main worries are:
- no foreigners or like-minded locals to make friends with
- big cities are too polluted, small towns have internet that's too bad, facilities that are too unreliable (thinking electricity and internet here mainly, I guess sewege might be decentralized) and too many mosquitos
- finding decently priced nice accommodations seems hard since afacit most things aren't listed on booking or airbnb, and the ones that are seem shoddy

What I'm currently looking for is a town with some amount of tourists, high-quality accommodations, decent weather (i.e. no monsoon going on but not too hot), decent pest control. I'm not sure if such a place exists, or if I'm barking up the wrong tree and the ""proper"" way to enjoy Sri Lanka is much different from what I have envisioned.

Either way, I'd love for some tips about wether or not it's a good destination and how to make the best of it.

My alternative is Funchal, but I'm kinda bored of Atlantic islands at this point."

rlenok,181m3usv,Anyone else forced to be a nomad?,"I wasn't literally forced to become a nomad, but it was my only reasonable option.

I consider my country as a follower of a cult, and I left that cult years ago, but it was too toxic to be in a cult country without following the cult, so I left before generating a solid income online, but I'm thankful I left with a lot of savings.

Expatriating was not an option because I couldn't secure a job abroad.

Right now, my lifestyle is pretty much work as much as possible while staying in apartments as cheap as possible and eating primarily bland food, which is not a situation I would have put myself in if my hometown was any good.

It came to the point that my life felt threatened back home.

If my hometown was good, I'd probably spend an average of three months a year there, such as when Airbnbs get too expensive and it's too hot to sightsee anyways."
rlfm8v,14l500,"Carrying a 24"" iMac while flying from city to city?","I'm thinking of buying iMac 24"" with M1 instead of my current 14"" HP laptop. I don't really like working in coffee shops and prefer working from Airbnbs. I always think that I hate looking at the screen so closely and think that 24"" iMac would be a healthier choice in that sense vs 13"" MacBook Air.

I change locations (cities) every 1-2 months and about every 3 months I fly to another country (I'm in Latin America for the last year and a half).

I worry that airlines may require me to pay extra to take it with me to the cabin (no way will I drop it as luggage) because here in Latin America they charge for everything. They take money for check-in even when their shitty websites crash and don't allow me to complete the check-in online.

Anyone has experience traveling with an iMac or a large external monitor or other similar stuff? What are your thoughts?

**Edit:** some people here suggesting using the TV in Airbnb as a monitor. Have you tried this yourselves? TVs can’t replace you a monitor because they don’t show the image pixel-to-pixel as your screen or a proper external monitor. They render brightness pixel-by-pixel but combine two pixels to render color ([read here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling)). It’s fine to watch movies but works bad for small text (code, webpages, etc)

Also, often times TVs are placed by some mad people: under the ceiling, in front of a bed (why?), or to the side from (not in front of) a couch."

rm5kg2,f4c68tpl,Romanian Parliament adopts law introducing visas for digital nomads,"Another in a growing number of EU countries introducing some kind of 'nomad visa'. I don't have any experience of Romania so it would be interesting to hear from anyone who has been there/is from there. 

At a quick glance, the cost of living seems reasonably low but other questions are often around how that translates for foreigners in terms of infrastructure, safety, people, locations/activities etc. 

Full article [HERE](https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-parliament-digital-nomads-visa), excerpt below. 

The Romanian Chamber of Deputies adopted on Tuesday, December 21, the draft law regulating the implementation of the digital nomad visa programme in Romania. The legal initiative offers digital travellers the possibility to obtain a long-term visa for Romania.

The Senate also voted in favour of the law in September, and the Chamber of Deputies gave the decisive vote. Next, the draft law has to be promulgated by president Klaus Iohannis and published in the Official Gazette to come into force.

The law was initiated by the parliamentary group USR PLUS. It defines the “digital nomad” as a foreigner who wishes to travel or reside in Romania for a period longer than six months and who is employed under an employment contract with a company registered outside Romania or has a company registered in a third country and continues to work for the employer or manage the company remotely using information and communication technology from Romania.

From an economic point of view, if Romania attracts 2.000 digital nomads annually, who would spend a monthly average EUR 2,000 in a year, this would translate into around EUR 50 million attracted to the national economy, according to a press release.

Among the states that have implemented the legal instrument concerning digital nomads are Germany, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Portugal, Croatia, Norway and some non-EU Member States such as Costa Rica, Georgia, Dubai, Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, Mexico, Australia, and Thailand."

rn0y9m,cqzw6m2d,Traveling during omnicron?,"New here. How does one travel around during omnicron? Have you needed to get a PCR test EVERY time you go to a new country ? Has anyone also taken buses and trains and did you have to give them a new test each time ?...

These rules and regulations are driving me insane as they keep changing and it's ruining my plans of trying to do this. Also I realise not every country allows nomad workers but do you know if it makes a difference if you only work in that country for a week only ? By this I am Canadian working for a Canadian company but I am allowed to temporarily work in different places and even abroad if I wish.

Edit: I should have clarified. The bus and trains like flixbus and eurorail are giant companies, they go all around Europe. I assumed people in this group would have taken those around Europe right now. I realise every country has different rules, so I am not literally asking for EVERY SINGLE countries example, I'm simply asking about other people's experiences using any of those giant company buses and trains that go all around Europe in general. i am also trying to compare prices of different buses and train companies so if you can give some names that would be good."

Just wondering if there are any digital nomads who have to remote log into another computer to do their work.  If so has anyone done that from the opposite side of the world from their remote computer. Just trying to gauge how feasible that might be.

I usually have to remote log into a computer in nyc/la which has been fine while in north america but now I will be heading to southeast asia and trying to get a rough idea how bad the lag may be."

ro5iuk,3qb3purq,Digital nomading to China's empty cities,"Has anyone ever looked into visiting China's empty cities as a digital nomad?

I realise any that are genuinely empty won't be ideal, but some are just very sparse while still having alot of amenities.

I've been to Bansko in Summer which almost feels like a ghost town that time of year (it's primarily a ski destination for those not in the know) and there's now quite a big digital nomad setup there.

I imagine if there's a completely empty apartment block near some good weather and nature this could conceivably be a good destination for ~100 nomads.

If you're not aware what these empty cities are [this](https://interestingengineering.com/chinas-ghost-cities-and-its-65-million-empty-homes) is a good write up.

Although it may sound stupid to some, living in an empty city. There are a few things to consider:

(1) people do own these properties. They're not built and unsold, they were bought before ever being built and just never lived in as second investment homes. It should then be feasible to find owners looking to rent short term.

(2) these aren't completely empty cities. Some that were empty 10-15 years ago but have just taken a very long time to fill. Some are now ranging from 30-90% full after being deserted a decade ago. So in many cases you'll have city amenities and infrastructure without the hustle and bustle of a city, which sounds perfect to me.

(3) some of the cities are very unique with micro versions of traditional Paris and London amongst some of the cities being built. This may seem strange or tacky but to me seems like an interesting place to experience for 2-3 months. There are of course more ""normal"" modern cities as well."
ro9adm,5ag27m7f,TAXES: What is the best country for incorporation for your digital nomad business?,"Hello everybody!I'm looking for the best places to incorporate a Digital Nomad business offshore for tax purposes.

I mostly sell services and digital products so I'm looking for the most tax-friendly territory to do so.

Most of my customers are based in western countries.

I'm a resident of a Latin American country, although I've been most of the time hopping on and off western and eastern Europe.

I'm currently looking at Hong Kong as the best candidate but as far as I know, isn't very straightforward the banking setup, at least with local banks but as far as I know might be a chance to do so with some other Fintech products.

UAE and Seychelles are some other options that I have seen often when I'm buying digital products from other companies offering similar services or products.

I have left out of the table the Caribean islands as most of them don't offer payment integrations.

I'm currently incorporated in Wyoming.

My main goal is to reduce the tax charge as close I can to zero.

Where have you incorporated your business? How was the experience there with the local law and authorities? Any Local firm you can recommend for handling the incorporation and tax consultation?

Thanks and Happy holidays to y'all!

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'm NOT US Citizen. I'm a natural-born Citizen of a Latinamerican country that doesn't have the resources to chase you down off their borders."

rovzkk,8r4k5hb8,"Existential crisis, traveling feels so random and meaningless, can you relate?","I've been traveling around since 2019 and I'm still convinced that the digital nomad lifestyle is the better choice for me, I can't imagine settling down... but I'm also feeling a little ""lost"". I'm not sure how to explain it... Like there's no ""final goal"" in all this traveling. I'm missing something that ties everything together, like a quest... 🧝🏻‍♀️. Do you know what I mean? Do you feel like this as well? Or are you fine with aimless country hopping? Or do you have a ""quest""? 

I know the most obvious thing is to have a travel blog, then all of this exploring has an aim... but I really don't think that the world needs another random travel blog written by an average person. And I'm not really interested in researching any travel advice beyond what I need for myself... What do you do to make traveling more meaningful? 

And probably that's a general life issue and not even a digital nomad issue... but I'm curious how other digital nomads are dealing with it."
rozina,ft4ff,A question about the complexity of programming on a digital nomad basis,"Hello there.

I have a serious issue and need some answers to add to the consideration process.

I live in Turkey. I am graduated from the Philosophy department and trying to be an author. Science fiction stories, comic-book scripts, magazine articles, etc. Spending 10-11 years with that dream, but never being able to do that diminished my passion. I am 30 years old now, I earn almost nothing rather than some awards which nobody cares about, some chances to be published in story anthologies nobody reads, etc. This is not going well and never will. (I have only written in Turkish so far)

So, I decided to switch areas of knowledge in order to get rid of this country, be a digital nomad, live a humble life, etc. Currently, I am taking some open education courses at a Turkish university. Computer programming is the major I chose. It will take 2 years to finish (if everything works perfectly), and education quality is way better than most of the online courses.

As you can see, it is way more different than what I have spent my life and learned about. I am overwhelmed and struggling to understand the fundamentals, stay focused, build decent motivation. I feel like I will never be able to pull that off.

For example, we are learning Visual Basic in Excel. The video class is 40-50 minutes long. Guess how many hours I spent just to understand the basics of the topic? 5 hours. The subject is just a simple task, using 2 different ""for-next"" (one of them is in the middle of the other one) and making a table that writes ""10"" (5 rows 5 columns table which compotes 10 in every cell). Simple, right? Not for me. I indeed can copy-paste the codes, but I need to understand why it computes that result, how it works, what kinds of mistakes I may do, how many different approaches can be chosen, -and most importantly- where I must use this, where do I need it? I am afraid of enrolling in a project and being stuck due to my not understanding programming, lack of knowledge, etc.

I have been saying ""You might not have to learn all of the programmings. HTML and some CSS may be enough. No need to learn a centillion of new things. Just sit and spend 2-3 years, see the results of your decision. But, I am not a young person now.""

So, questions:

* Will it be like this all the time? Would I be struggling and spending all of my time just to understand?
* Would it be enough just to learn the very basics? Is learning HTML and CSS, being a cheap web developer enough to make my digital nomad life consistent?
* I may try to improve my English and seek some work that I can ""execute"" with my existing skills. for example, content writing and editing. Would It be a better way to go on?

Thanks for reading all that stuff, and thanks for your answers.

PS: I want to live in a campervan with one of my friends. So, some of my expenses would be 0 if I can manage to set off."

rpoomz,qj7cj,Any communities to find like minded people/couples to travel with?,"Me and my wife have been living as DNs for half a year now and are currently in Sri Lanka. Making travel work in the current climate (primarily the shifting rules due to the pandemic) on top of a job + normal travel stuff is tiring us out pretty badly (we twice booked tickets by this point to go to Thailand and had to cancel them twice 😅 )... so I was thinking that it would probably be nice to find another couple to travel with for awhile. Just share some of the load, and it probably would open more options financially as well (what's up with all the crazy high salaries people post here 😭😂), etc. It's sometimes possible to meet people like that in hostels and hotels with shared common spaces... but those moments are rare, especially when you primarily stay in AirBnBs. 

Any advice on how/where to find people to travel with?"
